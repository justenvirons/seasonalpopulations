Although it has long been a major concern in time series models, however, in-depth treatments of temporal autocorrelation in modeling vehicle crash data are lacking. This paper presents several test statistics to detect the amount of temporal autocorrelation and its level of significance in crash data. The tests employed are: 1) the Durbin-Watson (DW); 2) the Breusch-Godfrey (LM); and 3) the Ljung-Box Q (LBQ). When temporal autocorrelation is statistically significant in crash data, it could adversely bias the parameter estimates. As such, if present, temporal autocorrelation should be removed prior to use the data in crash modeling. Two procedures are presented in this paper to remove the temporal autocorrelation: 1) Differencing; and 2) the Cochrane-Orcutt method.},

  abstract = {Traffic is the major air pollution source in most urban areas. Nowadays, most of the strategies carried out to improve urban air quality are focused on reducing traffic emissions. Nevertheless, acting locally on urban design can also reduce levels of air pollutants. In this paper, both strategies are studied in several scenarios for a medium-sized town of the Basque Country (Spain). Two main actions are analysed in order to reduce traffic emissions: (1) minor extension of a pre-existing low emission zone (LEZ); (2) substitution of 10\% of passenger cars that are older than 5 years by hybrid and electric vehicles. Regarding local urban design, three alternatives for the development of one side of a street canyon are considered: (1) a park with trees; (2) an open space without obstacles; (3) a building. Two different urban traffic dispersion models are used to calculate the air quality scenarios: PROKAS (Gaussian\&box) to analyse the reduction of traffic emissions in the whole urban area and WinMISKAM (CFD) to evaluate specific urban designs. The results show the effectiveness of the analysed actions. On one hand, the definition of a small LEZ, as well as the introduction in 2015 of vehicles with new technology (hybrid and electric), results in minor impacts on PM 10 and NO 2 ambient concentrations. On the other hand, local urban design can cause significant variation in spatial distribution of pollutant concentrations emitted inside street canyons. Consequently, urban planners should consider all these aspects when dealing with urban air pollution control.},

Access to locations with high-productivity jobs is increasingly limited by regional housing affordability barriers. Recent articles demonstrate a new regional divergence in access to high-productivity regions accompanied by declines in worker mobility associated with affordability barriers. We update these findings and discuss their long-term implications for economic opportunity and intergenerational welfare. We show that areas, from which lower-income households are increasingly priced out, are also more likely to have higher levels of intergenerational mobility. Access to opportunity also continues to be challenged within metropolitan areas as the gentrification of downtown neighborhoods is accompanied by an increase in concentrated poverty in outlying city neighborhoods and inner ring suburbs. These trends on regional and local scales derive from the increased importance of place in the knowledge-based economy and interact to reinforce growing spatial inequality. We conclude with a discussion of the importance of identifying place-based solutions to counter growing spatial inequality of opportunity.},

  abstract = {This essay is an intellectual conversation about the non-violent philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., and the possibility of using it to pursue social justice within the field of social work. The essay asks: In what ways can Gandhi and King's non-violent philosophy help professional social workers capture their inner feelings and thoughts that harbour resistance against social injustice, while, at the same time, seek love, common humanity, compassion and kindness? In what ways can Gandhi and King's ideas about nonviolence and their effects on the human psyche help today's social workers to pursue social justice in the global context? What are the real consequences of situating Gandhi and King's non-violent praxis in the pursuit of global social justice? To answer this question, this essay relies on data collected during the author's doctoral research in which he conducted open-ended semi-structured interviews of 20 purposively selected school activists in Toronto in 2009 and 2010. Six of the 20 participants were key informants for the study. This paper is about some of the responses of key informants about the non-violent philosophy of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr. and how it can be used to pursue social justice. This paper calls for a revolutionized reflection of Gandhi and King's non-violent philosophy. By that, this essay suggests bringing a discursive sophistication into their speeches and writings in ways that can inform and shape contemporary activism while acknowledging their shortcomings and limitations. Furthermore, this essay argues that, given the current charge against the social work profession that it is doing little to address social marginalization and injustices in society, a dedication to the non-violent philosophy of Gandhi and King can be a starting point to position members of the profession as forerunners in the pursuit of global social justice.},

Statewide variations are even more pronounced. North Dakota registers more than twice the national average and five times the rate of Massachusetts. We used panel models and annual data from 1997 to 2013 to capture the effect of seven separate sets of factors that influence traffic safety: exposure, travel behavior, socioeconomics, macroeconomics, safety policies, and mitigating factors such as health care. The results of our panel models and supplementary analysis of state effects show that two variables \textemdash{} Vehicle Miles Traveled and Vehicles per Capita\textemdash have the strongest impact on traffic fatality rates. This is closely followed by Infant Mortality Rates, the proxy that we used to represent the quality of health care. Policy levers such as Graduated Driver's Licenses (GDL) have improved safety, but to a limited extent. We also found that states with higher urban density and more walking are associated with lower traffic fatality rates. Taken as a whole, our findings suggest that if additional progress is to be made in reducing traffic fatalities, emphasis needs to move beyond simply focusing on policies such as GDL and seat belt laws, which have already been adopted by almost all jurisdictions across the United States. We need to also consider factors that focus on the type of urban form that we are creating to ensure that we are fostering environments that encourage multi-modal transportation such as walking to reduce the VMT and Vehicles per Capita, the two strongest predictors of traffic fatalities.},

  abstract = {Introduction In January 2015, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) announced that the official target of the federal government transportation safety policy was zero deaths. Having a better understanding of traffic fatality trends of various age cohorts\textemdash and to what extent the US is lagging other countries\textemdash is a crucial first step to identifying policies that may help the USDOT achieve its goal. Method In this paper we analyze fatality rates for different age cohorts in developed countries to better understand how road traffic fatality patterns vary across countries by age cohort. Using benchmarking analysis and comparative index analysis based on panel data modelling and data for selected years between 1990 and 2010, we compare changes in the rate of road traffic fatality over time, as well as the absolute level of road traffic fatality for six age groups in the US, with 15 other developed countries. Results-Conclusions Our findings illustrate tremendous variations in road fatality rates (both in terms of the absolute values and the rates of improvement over time) among different age cohorts in all of the 16 countries. Looking specifically at the US, our analysis shows that safety improvements for Youngsters (15-17 years old) was much better than for other age groups, and closely tracked peer countries. In sharp contrast, Children (0-14 years old) and Seniors (+65 years old) in the US, fare very poorly when compared to peer countries. For example, in 2010, Children in the US were a stunning five times more likely to experience a road traffic fatality than Children in the UK. Practical Applications This startling statistic suggests an immediate need to explore further the causes and potential solutions to these disparities. This is especially important if countries, including the US, are to achieve the ambitious goals set out in Zero Vision initiatives.},

First, the transfer data collected by GPS application are uploaded to the server database for data mining and processing. Then, we propose a recursive fuzzy linear regression model to explore the functional relationships among passengers' tolerances to distance, waiting time and their perceived factors. Results indicate that passengers who transfer by walk will be more sensitive to distance, while dockless bike-sharing users concern more about the time cost of finding available bike and the delay in traffic signals. Furthermore, our result also proves that pedestrian's tolerance to environment is higher than cyclist who uses dockless bike-sharing system.},

First identified in an outbreak in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 is affecting more than 185 countries and territories around the world, with more than 15,754,651 confirmed cases and more than 640,029 deaths. Since December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 transmission has become a global threat, which includes confirmed cases in all 50 states within the United States (US). As of 25 July 2020, the Johns Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering Center for Systems Science and Engineering reports more than 4,112,651 cases and 145,546 deaths. To date, health disparities are associated with COVID-19 mortality among underserved populations. Here, the author explores potential underlying reasons for reported disproportionate, increased risks of mortality among African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos with COVID-19 compared with non-Hispanic Whites. The author examines the underlying clinical implications that may predispose minority populations and the adverse clinical outcomes that may contribute to increased risk of mortality. Government and community-based strategies to safeguard minority populations at risk for increased morbidity and mortality are essential. Underserved populations living in poverty with limited access to social services across the US are more likely to have underlying medical conditions and are among the most vulnerable. Societal and cultural barriers for ethnic minorities to achieve health equity are systemic issues that may be addressed only through shifts in governmental policies, producing long-overdue, substantive changes to end health care inequities.},

Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data are considered to be highly suitable for the three-dimensional reconstruction of urban features such as buildings. Ongoing research is determining how best to integrate LiDAR elevation data with already available vector-based data. This paper reports research on combining building footprints and LiDAR to visualise an urban area (Portbury near Bristol, England) with an emphasis on representing buildings in a GIS environment. The main emphasis here is on retaining a vector model that is suitable for representing regular man-made structures. A major difference between this and earlier work is that before visualisation, this work classifies roof types of buildings as either flat or pitched. We compared LiDAR data at three point densities in terms of successful building type detection and visualisation: 1 (low), 16 (medium) and 40 (high) points per m2. There are important data acquisition cost issues at each of these resolutions. High density LiDAR yielded the highest overall accuracy of building type detection and proved useful for identifying roof features, yet lower densities proved more useful for revealing overall roof morphology.},

This study conducted an ecological evaluation of Chicago's UHI phenomena using LANDSAT TM of 2010, almost 15 years after the lethal heat wave and subsequently implemented various UHI mitigation efforts. The thermal characteristics of the city were assessed with a Land Surface Temperature (LST), a parameter retrieved from LANDSAT TM 6; a thermal-infrared (TIR) band (10.40 to 12.50{$\mu$}m), using monowindow algorithm. The ecological evaluation was made using an Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI), which quantitatively evaluated the UHI effects on the quality of urban life. The accuracy of the model was assessed against theoretical relationships between the LST, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). The LST of Chicago ranges from 18oC in Urban Cool Islands (UCI) to 44oC in UHI. In Chicago, although the cooling effects of Lake Michigan, downtown's sky-high buildings, and urban parks and green spaces have worked together to suppress the concerns of UHI effects locally, still some areas experience a high UHI. In general, 25\% of the city experiences ecologically bad or worse UHI effects, indicating a need for continued UHI mitigation efforts.},

And yet there are precious few great transit developments, little variety in the ones we do have, only rare examples of development profitability, and consequently, minimal motivation for our industry and our communities. Urban Transformation is really about providing the critical inspiration to change this situation. It is about restocking our weak architectural portfolio of transit facilities with dynamic new models. It is about recognizing the potential value and longevity of these projects, and making them exceptional rather than forgettable.The powerful cases in this book remove the excuses for mediocrity and mundane functionality, and show us how to excel. The text introduces an understandable typology of development around transit, and uses that to illustrate different strategies and design techniques. There is a broad range and scale of projects represented\textemdash large and small, domestic and global, big markets and modest communities\textemdash and each an excellent example of what can be realized.},

The last few decades have witnessed the rapid development of a variety of statistical models capable of representing the global structure of an observed network in terms of underlying generating mechanisms. The distinctive feature of statistical models for social networks is their ability to represent directly the dependence relations that these mechanisms entail. In this review, we focus on models for single network observations, particularly on the family of exponential random graph models. After defining the models, we discuss issues of model specification, estimation and assessment. We then review model extensions for the analysis of other types of network data, provide an empirical example, and give a selective overview of empirical studies that have adopted the basic model and its many variants. We conclude with an outline of the current analytical challenges.},

This is the story of how, why, and to what effect we put one foot in front of the other.  Walking has been the primary mode of locomotion for humans until very recent times when we began to sit and ride-first on horses and in carriages, then trains and bicycles, and finally cars, trucks, buses, and airplanes-rather than go on foot. The particular way we saunter, clomp, meander, shuffle, plod along, jaunt, tramp, and wander on foot conveys a wealth of information about our identity, condition, and destination. In this fast-stepping social history, Joseph A. Amato takes us on a journey of walking-from the first human migrations to marching Roman legions and ancient Greeks who considered man a "featherless biped"; from trekking medieval pilgrims to strolling courtiers; from urban pavement pounders to ambling window shoppers to suburban mall walkers. Concentrating on walking in Europe and North America and with particular focus on how walking differed according to social class, Amato distinguishes how, where, when, who, what, and under which conditions people moved on foot. He identifies crucial transformations in the history of walking, including the adoption of the horse by the mounted warrior; the rise of public display among European nobility; and the building of roads and transportation systems, which led to the inevitable ascent of the wheel over the foot.},

  abstract = {Abstract~~Modeling reactive transport in porous media, using a local chemical equilibrium assumption, leads to a system of advection\textendash diffusion PDEs coupled with algebraic equations. When solving this coupled system, the algebraic equations have to be solved at each grid point for each chemical species and at each time step. This leads to a coupled non-linear system. In this paper, a global solution approach that enables to keep the software codes for transport and chemistry distinct is proposed. The method applies the Newton\textendash Krylov framework to the formulation for reactive transport used in operator splitting. The method is formulated in terms of total mobile and total fixed concentrations and uses the chemical solver as a black box, as it only requires that one be able to solve chemical equilibrium problems (and compute derivatives) without having to know the solution method. An additional advantage of the Newton\textendash Krylov method is that the Jacobian is only needed as an operator in a Jacobian matrix times vector product. The proposed method is tested on the MoMaS reactive transport benchmark.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, geographical accessibility of urban resources for population living in residential areas has received an increased focus in urban health studies. Operationalising and computing geographical accessibility measures depend on a set of four parameters, namely definition of residential areas, a method of aggregation, a measure of accessibility, and a type of distance. Yet, the choice of these parameters may potentially generate different results leading to significant measurement errors. The aim of this paper is to compare discrepancies in results for geographical accessibility of selected health care services for residential areas (i.e. census tracts) computed using different distance types and aggregation methods. First, the comparison of distance types demonstrates that Cartesian distances (Euclidean and Manhattan distances) are strongly correlated with more accurate network distances (shortest network and shortest network time distances) across the metropolitan area (Pearson correlation greater than 0.95). However, important local variations in correlation between Cartesian and network distances were observed notably in suburban areas where Cartesian distances were less precise. Second, the choice of the aggregation method is also important: in comparison to the most accurate aggregation method (population-weighted mean of the accessibility measure for census blocks within census tracts), accessibility measures computed from census tract centroids, though not inaccurate, yield important measurement errors for 5\% to 10\% of census tracts. Although errors associated to the choice of distance types and aggregation method are only important for about 10\% of census tracts located mainly in suburban areas, we should not avoid using the best estimation method possible for evaluating geographical accessibility. This is especially so if these measures are to be included as a dimension of the built environment in studies investigating residential area effects on health. If these measures are not sufficiently precise, this could lead to errors or lack of precision in the estimation of residential area effects on health.},

  abstract = {Despite consistent reports of large-scale declines in air pollution over the past several decades in the US, those declines have not been consistent across the landscape. Low-income and African American communities consistently remain exposed to higher levels of air pollution than non-Hispanic whites (Arde, 2015). Researchers have pointed to inequalities in environmental exposure as one contributor to racial disparities in health outcomes across the US (Juarez et al., 2014). This chapter explores the potential role of air pollution hotspots in creating and maintaining health disparities over time. Focusing on EPA Region 5 (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin), we analyze the demographic characteristics of those block groups that were consistently hotspots for air pollution health risk for the four years following the Executive Order 12898 aimed at addressing these disparities. Estimates of the health risk of 572 industrial air toxics were obtained from the EPA Risk Screening Environmental Indicators Geographic Microdata (RSEI-GM). We find that the likelihood that an area becomes a hotspot, and the likelihood that it remains a hotspot over time is influenced by race and income. Block groups with greater percentage of low income African-Americans and Whites were more likely to become a hotspot over the time period studied. Block groups with a greater percentage of African-American residents were significantly more likely to remain hotspots over time, whereas hotspots with greater percentage of Hispanic residents were more likely to lose their hotspot status. This study revealed important information about the populations that are consistently exposed to toxic hotspots\textemdash and thus at the greatest risk for poor health outcomes. This is one step in understanding the potential role of hotspots in creating and maintaining disparities in health.},

The implied expected cruising-for-parking times are significantly lower than those that have been obtained through observation and simulation. Through computer simulation of cars cruising for parking around a circle in stochastic steady state, this paper shows that the approximation leads to underestimation of expected cruising-for-parking time and, at high occupancy rates, considerable underestimation. The paper also identifies several ``effects'' that contribute to the approximation being an increasingly poor one as the occupancy rate increases.},

Despite a wealth of related empirical studies, there has been little work formalising the hypothesis. This paper presents a trade-theoretic model, with three regions (downtown, suburbia and the rest of the world), four goods (a tradable home good, untraded services, a tradable foreign gooe and land), and two factors (skilled and unskilled workers). Blacks are constrained to live downtown but by incurring commuting costs can work in suburbia. Several exogenous changes are considered (for example a fall in transport costs between suburbia and the rest of the world) which may lead simultaneously to a fall in the downtown unskilled wage and to job suburbanisation, and which therefore provide a theoretical basis for the hypothesis.},

The method is easy to implement in standard statistical software, and it performs well even when the number of infected individuals is imperfectly measured, or the infection does not follow the SIR model. Our estimates of R for COVID-19 for 124 countries across the world are provided in an interactive online dashboard, and they are used to assess the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in a sample of 14 European countries.},

  abstract = {We study the impact of job proximity on individual employment and earnings. The analysis exploits a Swedish refugee dispersal policy to obtain exogenous variation in individual locations. Using very detailed data on the exact location of all residences and workplaces in Sweden, we find that having been placed in a location with poor job access in 1990\textendash 1991 adversely affected employment in 1999. Doubling the number of jobs in the initial location in 1990\textendash 1991 is associated with 2.9 percentage points higher employment probability in 1999. Considering that the 1999 employment rate was 43\% among the refugees, this is a considerable effect. The analysis suggests that residential sorting leads to underestimation of the impact of job access.},

The purpose of this paper is to resolve this paradox by explaining why and how geography matters for innovative activity and ultimately for the international comparative advantage. Globalization and the telecommunications revolution have triggered a shift in the comparative advantage of the leading developed countries towards an increased importance of innovative activity. This shift in comparative advantage has increased the value of knowledge-based economic activity. Since knowledge is generated and transmitted more efficiently via local proximity, economic activity based on new knowledge has a high propensity to cluster within a geographic region. This has triggered a fundamental shift in public policy towards business, away from policies constraining the freedom of firms to contract and towards a new set of enabling policies, implemented at the regional and local levels.},

However, besides all the challenges, there are also possibilities that are opening up. In this perspective, we focus on lessons from COVID-19 to increase the sustainability of health systems. If we catch the opportunities, the crisis might very well be a policy window for positive reforms. We describe the positive opportunities that the COVID-19 crisis has opened to reduce the sources of waste for our health systems: failures of care delivery, failures of care coordination, overtreatment or low-value care, administrative complexity, pricing failures and fraud and abuse. We argue that current events can canalize some very needy reforms to make our systems more sustainable. As always, political policy windows are temporarily open, and so swift action is needed, otherwise the opportunity will pass and the vested interests will come back to pursue their own agendas. Professionals can play a key role in this as well.},

If the data allows for parametric modeling, we demonstrate how likelihood approaches may be utilized to recover structural breaks. The estimation of multiple structural breaks is discussed. Furthermore, we cover how one can disentangle structural breaks (in the mean and/or the variance) on one hand and long memory or unit roots on the other.

The objective of this chapter is to describe some of the most recent data on long-distance travel by residents of the United States (US). Tabulation of federal public data for miles of travel by mode suggests long-distance travel comprises approximately 30\% of the passenger miles in the United States and has been growing over time. Consideration of 2016 survey data in Vermont on unmet travel need and 2017 survey data in California on self-reported long trips indicate that there is unmet demand for long-distance travel and that access, or at least participation, in long-distance travel is inequitably related to income and other factors. This differential access to intercity travel may translate to disadvantage in terms of quality of life or social capital. The use of big data to fill the long-standing gap in long-distance travel runs the risk of ignoring those with the inability to participate in global mobility, thereby demonstrating the disproportionate benefits and contributing negative externalities of long-distance travel. This chapter argues that even with the arrival of large quantities of mobile-device location information, those interested in transport equity must remain dedicated to advocacy for long-distance travel surveys that include person-level socioeconomic measures and trip information.},

A process for assessing the access characteristics of sidewalks was developed as part of a project to evaluate current conditions on sidewalks. This project is the Sidewalk Assessment Process. It was developed as a research tool for collecting objective information about sidewalk features such as grade and cross slope that impact pedestrian access. Measurements in cities across the United States were made to evaluate the accuracy of the process. It was determined from these measurements that accurate and reliable information about the accessibility of sidewalks could be collected using the process. The data were found useful to compare the dimensions of new construction and alterations on sidewalks with accessibility guidelines, to identify areas requiring additional maintenance to comply with standards, and to determine methods for solving access problems. The assessment process may be used as a stand-alone planning tool to help sidewalk professionals identify the means to improve pedestrian facilities in their jurisdictions or as part of a communitywide accessibility improvement program.},

We explored the effects of traffic safety, walk\textendash bike network facilities, and land use attributes on walk and bicycle mode choice decision in the New York City for home-to-work commute. Applying the flexible econometric structure of random parameter models, we capture the heterogeneity in the decision making process and simulate scenarios considering improvement in walk\textendash bike infrastructure such as sidewalk width and length of bike lane. Our results indicate that increasing sidewalk width, total length of bike lane, and proportion of protected bike lane will increase the likelihood of more people taking active transportation mode This suggests that the local authorities and planning agencies to invest more on building and maintaining the infrastructure for pedestrians. Further, improvement in traffic safety by reducing traffic crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists, will increase the likelihood of taking active transportation modes. Our results also show positive correlation between number of non-motorized trips by the other family members and the likelihood to choose active transportation mode. The model would be an essential tool to estimate the impact of improving traffic safety and walk\textendash bike infrastructure which will assist in investment decision making.},

In this manuscript, the role of official social network perturbations generated by public health officials to slow down or stop a disease outbreak are studied over distinct classes of static social networks. The dynamics are stochastic in nature with individuals (nodes) being assigned fixed levels of education or wealth. Nodes may change their epidemiological status from susceptible, to infected and to recovered. Most importantly, it is assumed that when the prevalence reaches a pre-determined threshold level, P*, information, called awareness in our framework, starts to spread, a process triggered by public health authorities. Information is assumed to spread over the same static network and whether or not one becomes a temporary informer, is a function of his/her level of education or wealth and epidemiological status. Stochastic simulations show that threshold selection P* and the value of the average basic reproduction number impact the final epidemic size differentially. For the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Small-world networks, an optimal choice for P* that minimize the final epidemic size can be identified under some conditions while for Scale-free networks this is not case.},

  abstract = {Investment in urban rail systems has increased rapidly over the past decades. While there have been some successful systems, a significant number have failed to be as successful as expected in improving public transport and urban environment. These experiences have led to a considerable debate in the literature about the effectiveness of new urban rail systems and whether it is worthwhile investing in them. While these debates continue, political support for metros, and particularly light rail systems, is still strong, and investment in them is very likely to continue. Hence, it is extremely important to understand the factors that make these systems successful. The paper presents the findings of a research aimed at identifying these factors based on the analysis of eight new urban rail systems: four in the USA, three in the UK and one in Canada. The paper presents the results of the performance analysis of the case studies as well as a detailed analysis of the factors that affected the performance of each system. Based on the case study analysis, a comprehensive list of factors that make urban rail systems successful is presented. The analysis also facilitates a comparison between the experiences of the three countries, and focuses on the effects of different operating environments and different planning approaches on the performance of urban rail systems. The paper concludes with a comparison of the findings of this research to those of previous studies.},

The aim of this study was to quantify and characterize these injuries. Methods We reviewed the electronic medical records of the University of Utah ED and the Salt Lake Regional Medical Center ED. Using a broad keyword search for ``scooter,'' we examined all notes for ED visits between June 15\textendash November 15, 2017, and June 15\textendash November 15, 2018, and identified e-scooter related injuries. The 2017 data pre-dated the launch of the e-scooter share programs in Salt Lake City and served as a control period. Results We noted 8 scooter-related injuries in 2017 and 50 in 2018. Injury types from the 2018 period included: major head injury (8\%); major musculoskeletal injury (36\%); minor head injury (12\%); minor musculoskeletal injury (34\%); and superficial soft tissue injury (40\%). 24\% of patients presented via ambulance and 6\% presented as a trauma activation. 16\% of patients required hospital admission and 14\% had an injury requiring operative repair. 16\% reported alcohol intoxication and none of the patients reported wearing a helmet at the time of the injury. Conclusion Since the launch of e-scooter share programs in Salt Lake City, we have seen a substantial increase in e-scooter related trauma in our EDs. Of particular note is the number of patients with major head injuries and major musculoskeletal injuries.},

  abstract = {In a recent paper, Bai and Perron (1998) considered theoretical issues related to the limiting distribution of estimators and test statistics in the linear model with multiple structural changes. In this companion paper, we consider practical issues for the empirical applications of the procedures. We first address the problem of estimation of the break dates and present an efficient algorithm to obtain global minimizers of the sum of squared residuals. This algorithm is based on the principle of dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares operations of order O(T2) for any number of breaks. Our method can be applied to both pure and partial structural change models. Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence intervals for the break dates under various hypotheses about the structure of the data and the errors across segments. Third, we address the issue of testing for structural changes under very general conditions on the data and the errors. Fourth, we address the issue of estimating the number of breaks. Finally, a few empirical applications are presented to illustrate the usefulness of the procedures. All methods discussed are implemented in a GAUSS program.

In this conceptual report, the third in a Series on equity and equality in health in the USA, we use a contemporary and historical perspective to discuss research and interventions that grapple with the implications of what is known as structural racism on population health and health inequities. Structural racism refers to the totality of ways in which societies foster racial discrimination through mutually reinforcing systems of housing, education, employment, earnings, benefits, credit, media, health care, and criminal justice. These patterns and practices in turn reinforce discriminatory beliefs, values, and distribution of resources. We argue that a focus on structural racism offers a concrete, feasible, and promising approach towards advancing health equity and improving population health.},

  abstract = {This article addresses how collaborative geospatial/geovisual decision support systems (C-GDSS) can achieve greater measures of spatial justice within an institutional, democratic framework for public goods allocation. Current public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) and participatory geographic information science (P-GIS) literature identifies issues of scale and consensus as problematic for such systems. C-GDSS deployments aimed at achieving spatial justice through small-scale, consensual processes fail when scaled to large processes involving heterogeneous groups where consensus is not realistically achievable. For this case study, we identify a significant deficit in the quality of public involvement in transportation infrastructure (TI) planning and design in the United States. We call this the Arnstein Gap. This exists in part because professionals lack confidence that they can integrate community cultural values, despite C-GDSS use, and have come to fear public engagement. To close the Arnstein Gap using C-GDSS we reconsider relationships among landscape, justice, and difference. The nature of power in the U.S. democratic polity and TI's role is examined and a geographical justice framework is derived from Rawls's (1971) theory of justice. We argue that within the normative framework of Jeffersonian democracy in the United States, spatial justice cannot be attained through an epistemology of distributional justice. Instead, it can more feasibly be attained by increasing procedural justice and access to justice. From these principles we develop a more suitable methodology for reflexive, large-scale group deployment of such systems termed structured public involvement (SPI). SPI holds that large-scale, nonconsensual collaborative TI planning is not oxymoronic, nor is it morally or practically inferior to other options. Methodological consideration is given to how geospatial and geovisual technologies can be used in TI design to elicit and respect cultural preferences. SPI consists of a reflexive public involvement framework that situates these technologies as dialogic media in participatory, nonconsensual collaborative planning and design. Two SPI case studies are discussed. AMIS is a participatory multicriteria/GIS corridor evaluation methodology and CAVE is a fuzzy-logic-based visual evaluation methodology. Anonymous real-time public process evaluation data demonstrate SPI's high performance. We discuss impediments, such as project sponsor's preferred Arnstein level, public participation patterns, professional resistance, and other considerations. This work has implications for collaborative public goods decision making using geovisual/geospatial methods in participatory democracies.},

We discuss the results of a day-long geology mapping exercise in the Tobacco Root Mountains, Montana, USA. Sixty-seven volunteer geologists, chosen specifically to represent a continuum from novice to expert, were asked to create a map of bedrock geology for approximately 70 square hectares. In order to identify and assess field mapping strategies, GPS tracks of each participant's field activities were analyzed using GIS and sequence alignment techniques. Results indicate differences in routes used during the field task by participants with varying levels of mapping expertise. To investigate this result, the field area was divided into thirty-three sub-regions based on topography, vegetation, rock outcrops, and participant traffic. Using these sub-regions, multiple variables such as amount of time spent in each sub-region and the order in which these sub-regions were visited were determined for each participant. Geologic mapping experts and others who are able to produce highly accurate maps recorded similar spatio-temporal sequences during the task, likely related to development of a reasonable structural hypothesis early in the task. These results have implications for field education and emphasize the role of working hypotheses in informing the movement of experts in the field.},

This transformation involves fundamental changes to forms of provision, patterns of access, forms of work, client-worker relations, inter-institutional relations and values and ethics. The constitution of citizenship has also been affected. The second concerns the conception of and engagement with social policy by educational researchers. A template for examination of the 'surface epistemology' of education policy research is presented-that is the relationships between conceptualisation, research design and conduct and the interpretation of data. It is argued that there is a basic tension at the heart of education policy research, between a commitment to the pursuit of efficiency and a commitment to the pursuit of social justice.},

The compact pattern of the new urbanist models of community development with integrated and mixed uses, pedestrian and vehicular orientation provides for public facility and retail locational characteristics which are in contrast to the sprawled, segregated, land-use pattern of the urban or suburban development. In the general schematic treatment of the new urbanist models, however, the specific space-economic features of the `core commercial areas' are given little attention, despite a vast theoretical and empirical literature on land use, and public and retail facility location. Land-use and retail location theories supply perspectives which aid in the assessment of the retail facilities in the core commercial areas, as well as of the general land-use pattern of new urbanism. The correlations between the properties of retail location theories used as assessment criteria and the properties of TND and TOD are noted. Furthermore, a typology of the neighborhood and/or community centers is provided which contrasts the features of the old with the new shopping centers, with reference to actual case examples. The transformation of the community shopping centers, reflective of the changing conventional wisdom and practice, exhibits an affinity with new urbanism. Both the changing conventional wisdom and the theoretical perspectives supplement the spatial planning paradigm of new urbanism. Thereby an observational and a metatheoretical basis is provided toward an assessment of the `feasibility' of the land-use and public (retail) facilities in the planned communities which are guided by the new urbanism.},

The solutions they proposed extended far beyond the river itself to include the organization of the city of Paris and its region. This interest in nitrogen led to the first calculations in France of nitrogen balance and flow and stimulated efforts to reduce nitrogen loss for hygienic, environmental, and agricultural reasons.

Although the marginal vehicle operating costs generated by changes to trip mileage or operating conditions are typically a small part of total project costs, they can be significant in deciding among alternative designs, construction scenarios, or project timing. Operating costs for personal vehicles (autos, pickups, SUVs, vans) are developed primarily from consumer guides, with an overall fleet average cost based on vehicle sales. Operating costs for large commercial trucks are based on a review of a number of sources of trucking costs. Factors for adjusting the costs based on stop-start conditions, pavement roughness, and inflation are derived from various sources. Results are that in a "baseline" case of highway driving on smooth pavement, with a fuel price of \$1.50 per gallon and other costs in 2003 dollars, personal vehicles average 17.1 cents per mile to operate and trucks average 43.4 cents per mile, not counting costs associated with the driver or travel time. City driving conditions, involving frequent stops and starts, increase this cost by 3.9 cents per mile for personal vehicles and 9.5 cents for trucks. Extremely rough pavement increases the baseline cost by 2.7 cents for personal vehicles and 5.5 cents for trucks.},

I argue that, during this transition, not only did the use of specific theories alter, but the very idea and practice of theorization also changed. I characterize the phases of this movement by using the terms "epistemological" and "hermeneutic theorizing," defined on the basis of works by pragmatist philosopher Richard Rorty and science studies writer Donna Haraway. I argue that "epistemological theorizing" best describes the first period of theorization in the discipline around the quantitative revolution of the late 1950s and early 1960s, and that it is bound by the quest for accurate (mirror) representation. In contrast, hermeneutic theorizing describes the kind of theorizing found in the new economic geography, marked by an interpretive mode of inquiry that is reflexive, open-ended, and catholic in its theoretical sources.},

  abstract = {Since the early 1990s a number of projects have developed indexes to measure vulnerability to environmental change. This article investigates the key conceptual and methodological problems associated with such indexes. It examines in detail an index that explicitly addresses environmental change as an issue of vulnerability, the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) developed by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC). This examination offers some broader lessons for indicator-based projects, all of which require a simple model of complex and uncertain social-ecological systems, and entail difficult choices about the selection, standardization, weighting, and aggregation of indicators selected to represent important aspects of those systems. We conclude that indexes of vulnerability to environmental change cannot hope to be meaningful when applied to large-scale systems, and so should focus on smaller scales of analysis.

  abstract = {Since the early 1990s a number of projects have developed indexes to measure vulnerability to environmental change. This article investigates the key conceptual and methodological problems associated with such indexes. It examines in detail an index that explicitly addresses environmental change as an issue of vulnerability, the Environmental Vulnerability Index (EVI) developed by the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC). This examination offers some broader lessons for indicator-based projects, all of which require a simple model of complex and uncertain social-ecological systems, and entail difficult choices about the selection, standardization, weighting, and aggregation of indicators selected to represent important aspects of those systems. We conclude that indexes of vulnerability to environmental change cannot hope to be meaningful when applied to large-scale systems, and so should focus on smaller scales of analysis. We argue that they should not be used as the basis for disbursing funds, comparing countries, or for measuring the performance of countries in environmental management.

  abstract = {Parking is becoming an expensive resource in almost any major city in the world, and its limited availability is a concurrent cause of urban traffic congestion, and air pollution. In old cities, the structure of the public parking space is rigidly organised and often in the form of on-street public parking spots. Unfortunately, these public parking spots cannot be reserved beforehand during the pre-trip phase, and that often lead to a detriment of the quality of urban mobility. Addressing the problem of managing public parking spots is therefore vital to obtain environmentally friendlier and healthier cities. Recent technological progresses in industrial automation, wireless network, sensor communication along with the widespread of high-range smart devices and new rules concerning financial transactions in mobile payment allow the definition of new intelligent frameworks that enable a convenient management of public parking in urban area, which could improve sustainable urban mobility. In such a scenario, the proposed intelligent parking assistant (IPA) architecture aims at overcoming current public parking management solutions. This study discusses the conceptual architecture of IPA and the first prototype-scale simulations of the system.},

Governance is defined as: 'the process of collective decision making and processes by which decisions are implemented or not implemented': it is concerned with the distribution, exercise, and consequences of power. Although there appears to be general agreement that the quality of governance is important for development, much less agreement appears to exist on what the concept really implies and how it should be used. Our review of the literature confirmed significant variation in meaning as well as in the practice of urban governance arrangements. The review found that the linkage between governance practices and health equity is under-researched and/or has been neglected. Reconnecting the fields of urban planning, social sciences, and public health are essential 'not only for improving local governance, but also for understanding and addressing global political change' for enhanced urban health equity. Social mobilization, empowering governance, and improved knowledge for sustainable and equitable development in urban settings is urgently needed. A set of strategic research questions are suggested.},

  abstract = {In recent years, shared-use vehicle systems have garnered a great deal of interest and activity internationally as an innovative mobility solution. In general, shared-use vehicle systems consist of a fleet of vehicles that are used by several different individuals throughout the day. Shared-use vehicles offer the convenience of the private automobile and more flexibility than public transportation alone. These systems are attractive since they offer the potential to lower a user's transportation costs; reduce the need for parking spaces in a community; improve overall air quality; and facilitate access to and encourage use of other transportation modes such as rail transit. Shared-use vehicle systems take many forms, ranging from neighborhood carsharing to classic station car models. Given the recent proliferation in system approaches, it is useful to establish a classification system or framework for characterizing these programs. The classification system presented here outlines key program elements that can help policy makers and practitioners characterize and evaluate various aspects of this rapidly evolving field. Further, it helps researchers analyze and compare the various models, including their similarities, differences, and benefits. A shared-use vehicle classification system is provided that describes existing and evolving models; examples are provided of each. It is argued that carsharing and station car concepts can be viewed as two ends of a continuum, sharing many similarities, rather than as separate concepts. Indeed, many existing shared-use vehicle systems can be viewed as hybrid systems, exhibiting key characteristics of both concepts.},

Across two experiments, the influence of visual field and spatial layout was manipulated using virtual reality. It was found that route choice was significantly influenced by the configuration of a space\textemdash The more consistently organized environment led to more systematic route choices. However, limiting the perception of distant visual information was found to influence route choice in a similar but completely independent way.

It evolved as a response to the Malthusian study The Limits to Growth (The Club of Rome, 1972). Like population biologist Paul Ehrlich, Professor James Krier of the University of Michigan Law School believes that the technological optimists may be wrong. Krier describes how the marginal costs of pollution control increasingly rise. He faults biologist Barry Commoner for neglecting population growth as the cause of pollution and positing the postwar technological transition as its cause. He argues that population growth forced this transition as science searched for substitutes for dwindling resources. Krier criticises as ``an article of faith'' the technological optimists' belief that `S-curve' patterns of technological advance will always arrive in response to the `J-curve' of exponential population growth. He thinks that the technological optimists may be deluding humanity by predicting the continual emergence of technological breakthroughs at ever-increasing rates. He favours growth policies that would allow humanity to ease into a steady state of resource use and minimise the maximum cost, which would be a global crash after technological innovation fails. Krier laments that modern technolgy can worsen pollution and invites problems of latency, irreversibility, `zero-infinity' risk and remoteness. He thinks that approapriate technologies which have failed economically may fail politically because the political process has been captured by opposing interests. Krier urges that the population crisis should be adressed instead},

Studies the social resources generated by group support networks and whether they benefit Asian-immigrant-owned small businesses. Presents evidence that Asian immigrants owning traditional small businesses, such as laundries, leave self-employment--which may actually be a form of underemployment--at a higher rate than nonminorities. Proposes that a combination of strong class resources and blocked mobility generates high rates of self-employment and demonstrates how this explains the self-employment behavior of Asian immigrants and the variations in self-employment rates among major Asian subgroups. Examines methods of financing small-business creation among Chinese and Korean entrepreneurs. Considers traditional and emerging lines of black-owned small businesses. Investigates factors shaping the black business community, including the small business owner's human capital, market accessibility, and access to financial capital.

  abstract = {Abstract.~~ How complex is the spatial economy? Some apostles of complexity argue that complex behaviour can arise in any system consisting of a largish number of intelligent, adaptive agents interacting on the basis of local information only. This paper examines several features of such dynamic systems, including path-dependence, emergence and self-organization. It goes on to explore their importance for the spatial sciences. Because space scales can change abruptly from local to global, strongly-interactive spatial economies sometimes exhibit astonishing collective properties, emergent features which are lawful in their own right. Segregation, self-similarity and the rank-size rule are familiar examples. To understand how collective order arises from seemingly random fluctuations, we must note how agents choose to interact with other agents and with their environment. We must synthesize rather than analyse. In the paper, self-organization is explored in a variety of contexts, including Schelling's model of neighborhood segregation and some work with cellular automata that has sharpened our insights into the collective synthesis of agents' interactions. Power laws are widely observed. A new way of doing social science \textendash{} agent-based simulation \textendash{} offers powerful new insights. It seems likely to revolutionize our field, along with the whole of the social sciences.

We first sketch our vision defining seven goals which concern: developing a new understanding of urban problems; effective and feasible ways to coordinate urban technologies; models and methods for using urban data across spatial and temporal scales; developing new technologies for communication and dissemination; developing new forms of urban governance and organisation; defining critical problems relating to cities, transport, and energy; and identifying risk, uncertainty, and hazards in the smart city. To this, we add six research challenges: to relate the infrastructure of smart cities to their operational functioning and planning through management, control and optimisation; to explore the notion of the city as a laboratory for innovation; to provide portfolios of urban simulation which inform future designs; to develop technologies that ensure equity, fairness and realise a better quality of city life; to develop technologies that ensure informed participation and create shared knowledge for democratic city governance; and to ensure greater and more effective mobility and access to opportunities for urban populations. We begin by defining the state of the art, explaining the science of smart cities. We define six scenarios based on new cities badging themselves as smart, older cities regenerating themselves as smart, the development of science parks, tech cities, and technopoles focused on high technologies, the development of urban services using contemporary ICT, the use of ICT to develop new urban intelligence functions, and the development of online and mobile forms of participation. Seven project areas are then proposed: Integrated Databases for the Smart City, Sensing, Networking and the Impact of New Social Media, Modelling Network Performance, Mobility and Travel Behaviour, Modelling Urban Land Use, Transport and Economic Interactions, Modelling Urban Transactional Activities in Labour and Housing Markets, Decision Support as Urban Intelligence, Participatory Governance and Planning Structures for the Smart City. Finally we anticipate the paradigm shifts that will occur in this research and define a series of key demonstrators which we believe are important to progressing a science of smart cities.

Rather than a call function to use the NetLogo software, NetLogoR is a translation into the R language of the structure and functions of NetLogo. Models built with NetLogoR are written in R language and are run on the R platform; no other software or language has to be involved. NetLogoR provides new R classes to define model agent objects and functions to implement spatially explicit agent-based models in the R environment. Users of this package benefit from the fast and easy coding provided by the highly developed NetLogo framework, coupled with the versatility, power and massive resources of the R language.

  abstract = {The recent proliferation of bike share schemes (BSS, also known as public bicycle use programs) in many cities has focused attention on their potential for reducing motorised traffic congestion, improving air quality and reducing car use. Since 2005, hundreds of bike share schemes have been implemented in many cities, with bike share usage patterns monitored in many of them. This paper assesses the development of BSS and provides a rationale for their potential health benefits. The key research question, as yet unanswered, is whether BSS themselves can contribute to improving population health, particularly through increasing population cycling, which would increase population levels of health-enhancing physical activity. This paper presents a framework for evaluating the contribution of BSS to population physical activity, and uses examples of new data analyses to indicate the challenges in answering this question. These illustrative analyses examine cycling in Australia, and [i] compares rates of cycling to work in BSS cities compared to the rest of Australia over time, and [ii] modelling trends in bike counts in Central Melbourne before and after introduction of the BSS in 2010, and compared to adjacent regions in nearby suburbs unexposed to a BSS. These indicative examples point to difficulties in attributing causal increases in cycling for transport to the introduction of a BSS alone. There is an evidence gap, and a need to identify opportunities to improve the health-related components of BSS evaluations, to answer the question whether they have any impact on population physical activity levels.},

A set of evaluation questions derived from this review and their application to an empirical piece of qualitative work frame an argument for a general set of criteria rather than rigid rules for assessing qualitative work.

Recent attention to biophilic design among architects and designers acknowledges this power of nature. However, in an increasingly urban planet, more attention needs to be aimed at the urban scales, at planning for and moving towards what the authors call ``biophilic cities''. Biophilic cities are cities that provide close and daily contact with nature, nearby nature, but also seek to foster an awareness of and caring for this nature. Biophilic cities, it is argued here, are also sustainable and resilient cities. Achieving the conditions of a biophilic city will go far in helping to foster social and landscape resilience, in the face of climate change, natural disasters and economic uncertainty and various other shocks that cities will face in the future. The paper identifies key pathways by which biophilic urbanism enhances resilience, and while some are well-established relationships, others are more tentative and suggest future research and testing.},

CnR was developed for use in communities where bus service is not cost-effective because of low to moderate residential and employment density, circuitous street networks, and dispersed geographic and temporal travel patterns but where demand is sufficient to warrant internal circulation or connection to the metropolitan transit network. The CnR service is characterized by a range of demand-responsive transportation service configurations, incorporating many-to-many services, scheduled checkpoints, zones, and flex routes tailored to the topography and travel patterns of each service area. In this paper, an analysis of data obtained primarily from CnR's automated scheduling system provides insight into the operations of demand-responsive transportation services for the general public. This insight may be used in other metropolitan areas for assessment of the feasibility of a CnR system.},

Because it is available for point-to-point trips, free-floating car-sharing is not only an alternative to private cars, but also to public transportation. Using spatial regression and conditional logit analysis of original transaction data of a free-floating car-sharing scheme in Switzerland, this research shows that free-floating car-sharing is mainly used for discretionary trips, for which only substantially inferior public transportation alternatives are available. In contrast to station-based car-sharing, it does not rely on high-quality local public transportation access, but bridges gaps in the existing public transportation network.},

Once-thriving communities in the Northeastern and Midwestern U. S. have decayed sharply as the high-wage manufacturing jobs that provided the foundation for their prosperity disappeared. A few larger cities had the resources to adjust, but most smaller places that relied on factory work have struggled to do so. Unless and until they find new economic roles for themselves, the small cities will continue to decline. Reinventing these smaller cities is a tall order. A few might still function as nodes of industrial production. But landing a foreign-owned auto manufacturer or a green energy plant hardly solves every problem. The new jobs will not be unionized and thus will not pay nearly as much as the positions lost. The competition among localities for high-tech and knowledge economy firms is intense. Decaying towns with poor schools and few amenities are hardly in a good position to attract the "creative-class" workers they need. Getting to the point where they can lure such companies will require extensive retooling, not just economically but in terms of their built environment, cultural character, political economy, and demographic mix. Such changes often run counter to the historical currents that defined these places as factory towns.},

Economists and other experts who favor increases in supply have failed to take these supply skeptics seriously. But left unanswered, supply skepticism is likely to continue to feed local opposition to housing construction, and further increase the prevalence and intensity of land-use regulations that limit construction. This article is meant to bridge the divide, addressing each of the key arguments supply skeptics make and reviewing what research has shown about housing supply and its effect on affordability. We ultimately conclude, from both theory and empirical evidence, that adding new homes moderates price increases and therefore makes housing more affordable to low- and moderate-income families. We argue further that there are additional reasons to be concerned about inadequate supply response and assess the evidence on those effects of limiting supply, including preventing workers from moving to areas with growing job opportunities. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing that new market-rate housing is necessary but not sufficient. Government intervention is critical to ensure that supply is added at prices affordable to a range of incomes.},

  abstract = {Multimodal journey planners tend to develop in cities so as to help a traveller to choose the most appropriate mode or modal combination according to the foreseen journey. However, multimodal journey planners do seldom take into account the time needed to park a car whereas it includes waiting and transfer times for public transport. This results in an underestimation of car travel time favouring this mode when compared to others such as public transport. In literature, car parking is mostly seen in a strategic point of view, dealing with the impacts assessment of parking policies. There is little knowledge about modelling the user's behaviour and the time needed to park a car. Axhausenet al. (1994) have experimented modelling off-street parking search time in Frankfurt. The model appears robust, but it has not been experimented for on-street parking. Therefore, the focus of this paper is on modelling on-street parking search time. The modelling starts from Axhausen'sproposal for off-street parking, but specificities of on-street parking allow for taking into account several models to estimate on-street parking search time. These models are then confronted to a survey done in several districts of Lyon. The results of this confrontation give interesting conclusions about on-street parking search time modelling, validation and further research needs in order to improve the model robustness},

In the pursuit of solutions to urban problems, Bartholomew concluded that the most efficient way to revitalize St. Louis, Missouri, was through the clearing of slums. In an attempt to solve the city's economic and demographic problems, slum clearance destroyed and displaced Black neighborhoods whose 70,000 residents were seen as detrimental to the city's success. Bartholomew's planning was in line with the public administration theoretical perspective of administrative evil, which states that technical-rational specialists sometimes commit acts of cruelty without intending to. Through his attempts to revitalize and renew the city, Harland Bartholomew did a great deal of evil to Black populations in St. Louis. This article identifies the ways that Bartholomew's administrative evil was masked and perceived as a moral good despite its displacement of Black residents.},

Recent interpretations of the concepts of sustainability, assessment and community are discussed before reviewing existing assessment systems. In particular, the systems BREEAM for Communities, LEED for Neighbourhood Development and CASBEE for Urban Development are presented and compared. Each one of these systems bases the assessment on the summation of rates for different criteria often similar to those considered in sustainability assessments of buildings. The comparison shows that existing systems often accept a weak sustainability where natural resources may be subsidized by other priorities. Missing assessment criteria are proposed mainly within the social and economic dimensions of sustainability. This paper also shows that the dynamicity of a community suggests considering the sustainability assessment systems as tools to monitor the evolution of communities. Finally, it shows that an increase in citizen engagement in the selection of assessment criteria is necessary to share priorities and customize sustainability goals for each community.},

While diversity, as a proxy for tolerance, has proven to be a relatively weak pull-factor at the inter-metropolitan level, the potential role of neighborhood-level diversity in the residential location of creative class workers has yet to be explored empirically. In this study we use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to test the hypothesis that there exists significant associations between particular types of neighborhood diversity (i.e., sexual orientation, language, race, and income) and the proportion of workers with specific creative class occupations. The results of our Chicago case study suggest a significant positive relationship between the creative class and the proportion of gay households and income diversity, but not racial or linguistic diversity. Overall, diversity appears to play a limited role in predicting where creative class workers reside, though the GWR analysis indicated substantial spatial variation in the strength of association between neighborhood diversity and creative class share across the study area.},

In order to create living environments that stimulate older adults to engage in social activities, more insight is needed in the social activity patterns of the aging population. This study therefore analyzes the heterogeneity in older adults' preferences for different social activity location types and the relationship between these preferences and personal and mobility characteristics.  This is done using a latent class multinomial logit model based on two-day diary data collected in 2014 in Noord-Limburg in the Netherlands among 213 respondents aged 65 or over. The results show that three latent classes can be identified among the respondents who recorded social activities in the diary: a group that mainly socializes at home, a group that mainly socializes at a community center and a group that is more likely to socialize at public `third' places. The respondents who did not record any interactions during the two days,  are considered as a separate segment. Relationships between segment membership and personal and mobility characteristics were tested using cross-tabulations with chi-square tests and analyses of variance. The results suggest that both personal and mobility characteristics play an important role in social activity patterns of older adults.},

We also find regional differences in the distribution of community resilience and social vulnerability, with the West being particularly vulnerable while the Southeast is prone to low levels of resilience. By looking at both social vulnerability and community resilience, we are able to map communities' social risks for harm from threats as well as their capacities for recovering and adapting in the aftermath of hazards. This provides a more complete portrait of the communities that might need the most assistance in emergency planning and response, as well as whether such interventions will need to be tailored toward reducing damage or finding the path to recovery.},

It is increasingly being used to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions ranging from clinical therapy to national public health legislation. Whereas the design shares many properties of regression-based approaches in other epidemiological studies, there are a range of unique features of time series data that require additional methodological considerations. In this tutorial we use a worked example to demonstrate a robust approach to ITS analysis using segmented regression. We begin by describing the design and considering when ITS is an appropriate design choice. We then discuss the essential, yet often omitted, step of proposing the impact model a priori. Subsequently, we demonstrate the approach to statistical analysis including the main segmented regression model. Finally we describe the main methodological issues associated with ITS analysis: over-dispersion of time series data, autocorrelation, adjusting for seasonal trends and controlling for time-varying confounders, and we also outline some of the more complex design adaptations that can be used to strengthen the basic ITS design.},

The national long-distance model is a tour-based simulation model developed from FHWA research on long-distance travel behavior and patterns. The tool allows the evaluation of many policy scenarios, including fare or service changes for various modes, such as commercial air, intercity bus, Amtrak rail, and highway travel. The availability of this tool presents an opportunity for state departments of transportation in developing statewide models. Commercial big data from cell phones for long-distance trips also pre-sents an opportunity and a new data source for long-distance travel patterns, which previously have been the subject of limited data collection, in the form of surveys. This project is the first to seize on both of these opportunities by integrating the national long-distance model with the new Tennessee statewide model and by processing big data for use as a calibration target for long-distance travel in a statewide model. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of integrating the national model with statewide models, the ability of the national model to be calibrated to new data sources, the ability to combine multiple big data sources, and the value of big data on long-distance travel, as well as important lessons on its expansion.},

It presents three key findings: (1) mixed-income housing often becomes a proxy for diversity; (2) the diversity concept can support progressive politics while downplaying certain racial and class disparities; and (3) a focus on neighborhood diversity can obscure issues that poor people care about, including tenants rights. By providing a microlevel perspective on diversity discourse, these findings demonstrate how a shared symbol can both illuminate and veil fundamental disagreements over race, class, inequality, and gentrification in cities today.},

  abstract = {The equitable distribution of transit services is a major concern of transportation planners and policy makers worldwide. In the United States, planners are required by executive order to consider equity concerns when investing in new transportation infrastructure and services. However, equity can be difficult to assess in a consistent, objective, and quantitative way. Australian researchers recently developed a single, systemwide measure that reflects the equity of transit service distribution in a metropolitan area. This measure, known as a Gini coefficient, measures specifically how well transit supply meets transit demand. Transit supply is measured with a modified form of an established supply index, and demand is estimated with population and employment data. Although the idea of a single measure for assessing the equity of a transit system is appealing, researchers and practitioners must be careful when they implement Gini coefficients for comparative purposes. This research investigated the effect of selecting various scales, boundaries, and demand measures for calculating Gini scores for interregional comparisons. Gini coefficients were calculated for six urban transit systems within two boundaries (metropolitan statistical area and transit service area) at two scales (census tract and block group) with two demand measures (population and population plus employment). Results suggest that calculations with Gini coefficients on the basis of various boundary definitions can lead to drastically different comparative results, whereas the different scales and demand measures had little impact on interregional comparisons.},

  abstract = {The knowledge of the transportation mode used by humans (e.g. bicycle, on foot, car and train) is critical for travel behaviour research, transport planning and traffic management. Nowadays, new technologies such as the Global Positioning System have replaced traditional survey methods (paper diaries, telephone) because they are more accurate and problems such as under reporting are avoided. However, although the movement data collected (timestamped positions in digital form) have generally high accuracy, they do not contain the transportation mode. We present in this article a new method for segmenting movement data into single-mode segments and for classifying them according to the transportation mode used. Our fully automatic method differs from previous attempts for five reasons: (1) it relies on fuzzy concepts found in expert systems, that is membership functions and certainty factors; (2) it uses OpenStreetMap data to help the segmentation and classification process; (3) we can distinguish between 10 transportation modes (including between tram, bus and car) and propose a hierarchy; (4) it handles data with signal shortages and noise, and other real-life situations; (5) in our implementation, there is a separation between the reasoning and the knowledge, so that users can easily modify the parameters used and add new transportation modes. We have implemented the method and tested it with a 17-million point data set collected in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. The accuracy of the classification with the developed prototype, determined with the comparison of the classified results with the reference data derived from manual classification, is 91.6\%.},

However, these capabilities have yet to be fully explored in public practice. In this paper we first discuss a general framework for performing transportation equity analysis using activity-based travel demand models, distributional comparisons, and incorporating equity standards. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of distributional comparisons, relative to average measures. This demonstration uses the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey and (activity-based) mode choice model. The findings show that distributional comparisons are capable of clearly revealing the winners and losers that result from transportation improvements, in comparison with average measures. The use of these results will likely result in different conclusions on transportation investments.},

Data were obtained from the 1980 census on a matrix of number of employees for 10 occupations disaggregated by residence, workplace, gender, \& white or black race. The spatial mismatch hypothesis is supported only in that a higher rate of unemployment for central city females (Fs) exists because of difficult access to low skill suburban jobs. The major factors behind central city unemployment problems are failure to complete high school \& prevalence of F-headed families, particularly in areas with centralized black population \& areas dependent on manufacturing employment. Efforts to redress the unemployment problem should concentrate on achieving a higher rate of high school completion, targeting Fs in northeast \& northcentral cities. Efficient city-to-suburb transit systems, low-income suburban housing, \& removal of discrimination in urban labor \& housing markets are also needed. 4 Tables, 30 References. V.

The National Institutes of Health four-phase model of transdisciplinary team-based research is drawn on and adapted to reflect on what has worked well and what has not operationally. Results underscore the need for experienced academics open to new collaborations and ways of working; clarity of leadership without compromising exploration; clarification of the poorly understood ``impacts interface'' and navigation toward effective real world impact; acknowledgement of the additional time and resource required for transdisciplinary research and ``nonacademic'' researchers. Having practitioner-researchers as part of the research leadership team requires rigourous reflective practice and effective management, but it can also ensure breadth in transdisciplinary outlook as well as constant course correction toward real-world impact. It is important for the research community to understand better the opportunities and limitations provided by knowledge intermediaries in terms of function, specialism, and experience.},

The chapters are organized into four themed sections: the role of geography in health care reform; the geographies of human health; geospatial data and technologies; and geography in medicine. It is a highly informative book, providing scientific insight for geographers with an interest in advanced geospatial applications and health research. The author is an international expert in geography, GIS, and public health, who co-edited a special issue on ``Geospatial Applications in Disease Surveillance,'' published in the~International Journal of Applied Geospatial Research.'Health, Science, and Place is a well-intentioned overview of medical geography in the context of the ACA. Blatt does an excellent job synthesizing ecologic and geographic literatures with what we know about individual health, health care systems, and public health. \ldots{} this book fills a need in the field by offering a timely discussion of the ACA and medical geography.'- Jennifer L. Moss, The AAG Review of Books, Vol. 4 (2), 2016 ``Amy Blatt's pioneering new book on geomedicine and its exciting capacity to promote health and minimize risk is a robust call for understanding the role of geography for everyone's quality of life. In Health, Science, and Place: A New Mode, Dr. Blatt's contributions can be summarized in three categories: comprehensive analysis, creative curating, and targeted innovations...~Overall, Dr. Blatt's Health, Science, and Place: A New Model is a pathbreaking book challenging all public health and health communication scholars and practitioners to explore vigorously the role of medical geography as a shining new bridge between geography and patient care.'' - John C.

  abstract = {Geography, as the discipline responsible for describing the organization of space, has developed several ways of dealing with the phenomenon of the central city and its surrounding hinterlands. One of the most prominent of models used is von Th\~A{$\frac{1}{4}$}nen's Isolated State, a predictive model of how rural hinterlands organize agricultural production in relation to an urban center. Despite today's globalized food provisioning system, there are still some agricultural commodities that remain in U.S. city hinterlands. The most prominent of these is milk. The spatial organization of dairying is therefore a topic in which von Th\~A{$\frac{1}{4}$}nen's notions of centrality are still pertinent. In addition, outside of geography, his ideas had a significant effect on the agricultural economists who formulated dairy marketing policy. This paper will examine von Th\~A{$\frac{1}{4}$}nen and notions of centrality in the formulation of dairy policy in the United States. His contribution has been very important to agricultural economists and agricultural geographers but less important to sociologists of agriculture, who see the spatial organization of food production around cities due as much to contingent, local political outcomes as to law-like notions of centrality. Comparative historical method in sociology has been particularly useful in determining the role of predictive models and contingency in determining the spatial organization of milksheds.},

After controlling for other characteristics likely to affect welfare behavior, we find that welfare usage declines as geographic job access increases.

  author = {Bolt, G. S. and Van Kempen, R.},

  abstract = {This article attempts to answer two questions. First, it describes and explains segregation and concentration of one minority ethnic group (Turks) in three middle-sized Dutch cities (Amersfoort, Delft, and Den Bosch). The question is whether or not segregation and concentration have increased and how this can be explained. This information adds to existing knowledge about the largest cities in the Netherlands. One of the main conclusions is that, compared to big cities in the Netherlands, Turks in middle-sized cities have penetrated more in the early post-World War II areas. Segregation levels in middle-sized cities are, however, not necessarily smaller compared to those in the big cities. Second, the article focuses on Turks housing conditions in these cities. The question here is whether or not housing conditions differ between concentration areas and other areas within the city. The answer is based largely on the opinions of the Turks themselves. The main conclusion here is that many Turks are not very happy with their present housing. There was no evidence of a relationship between segregation and ties with the mother country. Nor does the presence of other Turks contribute significantly to an explanation of neighbourhood choice of those Turks who have indicated a preference to move. It must be concluded that segregation and concentration should be explained by the income position of Turks. Their low incomes limit their options for moving to better dwellings. The notion that Turks live among other Turks by choice should, on the basis of this research, be abandoned.},

The case studies demonstrate that green technologies developed and instituted in core nations often require specific raw materials that are extracted from the periphery and semi-periphery. Extraction of such natural resources causes significant environmental degradation and often displaces entire communities from their land. Moreover, because states often use violence and repression to facilitate raw material extraction, the widespread commercialization of green technologies can result in serious human rights violations. These findings challenge ecological modernization theory, which rests on the assumption that the development and commercialization of more ecologically-efficient technologies is universally beneficial.},

  abstract = {The world's cities are on pace to balloon from 3.6 billion inhabitants today to more than 6 billion by mid-century. As a result, we face both a dire emergency and a tremendous opportunity. At their best, our modern cities are hubs of human connection, fountains of creativity, and exemplars of green living. Yet at the same time, they still suffer the symptoms of industrial urbanization: pollution, crowding, crime, social fragmentation, and dehumanization. Now is the time to envision what cities can be and to transform them. This book, produced in partnership with the Atlantic Cities, celebrates 12 promising, provocative responses to this challenge, in realms ranging from transportation to food to art. It asks and begins to answer: How can we transform cities to be sustainable, efficient, beautiful, and invigorating to the human soul? And practically speaking, how do we get from here to there?},

  abstract = {This book introduces multidimensional scaling (MDS) and unfolding as data analysis techniques for applied researchers. MDS is used for the analysis of proximity data on a set of objects, representing the data as distances between points in a geometric space (usually of two dimensions). Unfolding is a related method that maps preference data (typically evaluative ratings of different persons on a set of objects) as distances between two sets of points (representing the persons and the objects, resp.). This second edition has been completely revised to reflect new developments and the coverage of unfolding has also been substantially expanded. Intended for applied researchers whose main interests are in using these methods as tools for building substantive theories, it discusses numerous applications (classical and recent), highlights practical issues (such as evaluating model fit), presents ways to enforce theoretical expectations for the scaling solutions, and addresses the typical mistakes that MDS/unfolding users tend to make. Further, it shows how MDS and unfolding can be used in practical research work, primarily by using the smacof package in the R environment but also Proxscal in SPSS. It is a valuable resource for psychologists, social scientists, and market researchers, with a basic understanding of multivariate statistics (such as multiple regression and factor analysis).},

We briefly describe the history of urban models, and present a taxonomy of needed refinements to them. We then present a case study of the UrbanSim model system and a significant application of it to the Puget Sound Area in Washington State. We also situate this effort in the digital government research arena, in which is presents a significant research opportunity: hard technical problems, unmet demand from government users, and important issues around supporting a more democratic planning process.},

Focusing upon all residents of West Virginia, the study identifies the number and characteristics of persons who reside within and beyond the 30-minute standard. More than 10 per cent of the entire population and nearly 20 per cent of the rural residents live in areas which are, by this standard, inaccessible to general hospitals. The ``inaccessible'' populations are characterized as having sociodemographic attributes associated with high medical needs. Other applications of travel time data are discussed.         \textcopyright{} Lippincott-Raven Publishers.},

First, we test to determine if there is significant segregation within each of the four ethnbic groups and we find that there is, except for Blacks. Although the index of dissimilarity suggests that there is segregation by socioeconomic status within Miami's Black population, map analysis revals that this is not the case. Furthermore, we find that socioeconomic status is not an important factor explaining metropolitan Miami's segregation patterns between these four ethnic groups. When it comes to residential segregation, Miami is similar to most other American cities. This is a significant finding because several recent studies have suggested that standard assimilation theory does not apply to Miami, and segregation is one aspect of assimilation.},

This is the quest of General Systems Theory. It does not seek, of course, to establish a single, self-contained ``general theory of practically everything'' which will replace all the special theories of particular disciplines. Such a theory would be almost without content, for we always pay for generality by sacrificing content, and all we can say about practically everything is almost nothing. Somewhere however between the specific that has no meaning and the general that has no content there must be, for each purpose and at each level of abstraction, an optimum degree of generality. It is the contention of the General Systems Theorists that this optimum degree of generality in theory is not always reached by the particular sciences.},

This paper tests five separate but related hypotheses concerning the outcomes of this process and whether they suggest the emergence of new urban forms. The analysis builds on the results reported in an earlier paper using data on the changing intra-urban properties of the 27 largest urban areas in Canada. The empirical results confirm the hypotheses of a continued decentralization of population and employment and of an increasingly diverse social and ethnocultural landscape. A spatial mismatch between the distribution of jobs and labour is confirmed by journey-to-work data, but primarily for inner city residents. In addition, these data suggest that, despite the rapid sub-urbanization of employment, a distinct multi-nucleated urban form has not as yet emerged. -from Author},

Mediated approaches may ameliorate contextual factors which inhibit participation in traditional methods, and, specifically, Web-based participatory activities would cast a wider net in the community, harnessing more and more diverse input. This paper discusses a P2 model utilizing ``crowdsourcing,'' which is a Web-based, distributed problem solving model already in use by a number of online businesses, a model which promises to be such an alternative P2 method for public transit planning. This paper draws from a Federal Transit Administration (FTA) pilot project focused on the application of crowdsourcing to bus stop design at the neighborhood scale. We introduce the concept of crowdsourcing and then discuss the components of transit stop design. This is followed by preliminary results from Next Stop Design, our first case study in transit stop design.},

In many cases, the interoperability issues arise from the use of rudimentary information systems, or even paper-based procedures, to manage operational data such as schedules and tariffs. In these cases, exchanging data with external systems is very difficult. This paper describes the development of a web-based application aiming to simplify the creation and editing of public transportation data that could be easily exchanged in a normalized format. This description is preceded by a discussion about a data model that could ease data interoperability. Here, the GTFS reference, with some adjustments, is used as a guideline for the definition of such transportation data model.},

  abstract = {In economic literature, the quality of life (QoL) in a city is usually assessed through the standard revealed-preference approach, which defines a QoL index as the monetary value of urban amenities. This paper proposes an innovative methodology to measure urban QoL when equity concerns arise. The standard approach is extended by introducing preferences for even accessibility to amenities throughout the city into the QoL assessment. The QoL index is then reformulated to account for the unequal availability of amenities across neighbourhoods. The more unbalanced the distribution of amenities across neighbourhoods, the lower the assessment based on the new index. This methodology is applied to derive a QoL index for the city of Milan. The results show that the unequal distribution of amenities across neighbourhoods significantly affects the assessment of QoL for that city.},

  abstract = {Background: Cycling for transportation has become an increasingly important component of strategies to address public health, climate change, and air quality concerns in urban centers. Within this context, planners and policy makers would benefit from an improved understanding of available interventions and their relative effectiveness for cycling promotion. We examined predictors of bicycle commuting that are relevant to planning and policy intervention, particularly those amenable to short- and medium-term action. Methods: We estimated a travel mode choice model using data from a survey of 765 commuters who live and work within the municipality of Barcelona. We considered how the decision to commute by bicycle was associated with cycling infrastructure, bike share availability, travel demand incentives, and other environmental attributes (e.g., public transport availability). Self-reported and objective (GIS-based) measures were compared. Point elasticities and marginal effects were calculated to assess the relative explanatory power of the independent variables considered. Results: While both self-reported and objective measures of access to cycling infrastructure were associated with bicycle commuting, self-reported measures had stronger associations. Bicycle commuting had positive associations with access to bike share stations but inverse associations with access to public transport stops. Point elasticities suggested that bicycle commuting has a mild negative correlation with public transport availability (\`A0.136), bike share availability is more important at the work location (0.077) than at home (0.034), and bicycle lane presence has a relatively small association with bicycle commuting (0.039). Marginal effects suggested that provision of an employer-based incentive not to commute by private vehicle would be associated with an 11.3\% decrease in the probability of commuting by bicycle, likely reflecting the typical emphasis of such incentives on public transport. Conclusions: The results provide evidence of modal competition between cycling and {$\Uparrow$} Corresponding author at: Department of City and Regional Planning, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Campus Box 3140, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-3140, USA.},

It has also given new impetus to the struggles of urban social movements emphasizing the injustice, destructiveness and unsustainability of capitalist forms of urbanization. This book contributes analyses intended to be useful for efforts to roll back contemporary profit-based forms of urbanization, and to promote alternative, radically democratic and sustainable forms of urbanism.  The contributors provide cutting-edge analyses of contemporary urban restructuring, including the issues of neoliberalization, gentrification, colonization, "creative" cities, architecture and political power, sub-prime mortgage foreclosures and the ongoing struggles of "right to the city" movements. At the same time, the book explores the diverse interpretive frameworks \textendash{} critical and otherwise \textendash{} that are currently being used in academic discourse, in political struggles, and in everyday life to decipher contemporary urban transformations and contestations. The slogan, "cities for people, not for profit," sets into stark relief what the contributors view as a central political question involved in efforts, at once theoretical and practical, to address the global urban crises of our time.  Drawing upon European and North American scholarship in sociology, politics, geography, urban planning and urban design, the book provides useful insights and perspectives for citizens, activists and intellectuals interested in exploring alternatives to contemporary forms of capitalist urbanization.},

  abstract = {As part of the EU-funded SAVIAH project, a regression-based methodology for mapping traffic-related air pollution was developed within a GIS environment. Mapping was carried out for NO2 in Amsterdam, Huddersfield and Prague. In each centre, surveys of NO2, as a marker for traffic-related pollution, were conducted using passive diffusion tubes, exposed for four 2-week periods. A GIS was also established, containing data on monitored air pollution levels, road network, traffic volume, land cover, altitude and other, locally determined, features. Data from 80 of the monitoring sites were then used to construct a regression equation, on the basis of predictor environmental variables, and the resulting equation used to map air pollution across the study area. The accuracy of the map was then assessed by comparing predicted pollution levels with monitored levels at a range of independent reference sites. Results showed that the map produced extremely good predictions of monitored pollution levels, both for individual surveys and for the mean annual concentration, with r2 0.79-0.87 across 8-10 reference points, though the accuracy of predictions for individual survey periods was more variable. In Huddersfield and Amsterdam, further monitoring also showed that the pollution map provided reliable estimates of NO2 concentrations in the following year (r2 0.59-0.86 for n 20).},

If the full potential of this new class of data is to be realized, processing techniques will need to be standardized and automated to some degree. This paper develops a multinomial logit (MNL) model to impute travel mode from GPS and hip-mounted accelerometer data. The MNL model is the workhorse of travel demand modeling, but it has rarely been applied to GPS data processing. A web-based recall survey provided over 900 trips for estimation and 500 plus trips for validation from a larger multi-day GPS travel survey in Portland, Oregon. Special attention is given to the imputation of bicycle travel, the identification of which has been given little attention in the North American context. We also apply two existing non-MNL mode imputation models to our Portland data and to compare and test the broader transferability of specific techniques. We find that the MNL model as specified performs well overall, generally outperforming competing model forms on the Portland GPS data. Transit network data and accelerometer data significantly improve model fit for specific modes. Accelerometer data is found in particular to aid model fit for bicycling; however, external validation results were less clear. No benefit is found to segmenting models by traveler age, although not all age groups were covered by the sample. The MNL model shows strong potential for automated GPS processing and, as a commonly used transportation modeling technique, should be relatively easy to implement elsewhere.},

A central weakness is the lack of communication between PSS developers (focusing on technical issues) and potential PSS users. Other academic fields such as knowledge management and technological innovation recognised similar bottlenecks years ago. On the basis of methods proposed in these fields, a new process architecture for the development of a PSS is proposed. Through a dialogue in which PSS developers and potential users discuss and use the PSS, existing tools, instruments, and models are refined and improved to be more useful to their potential users. The focus shifts away from the development of a technically more sophisticated support system, towards a process of PSS development which is intertwined with the planning process itself. This process architecture is called mediated planning support (MPS). We explore what can be learned from other academic domains and enquire about the applicability of these findings to PSS development. In Amsterdam the Department of Transport wanted to transform their transportation model into a land-use and transport PSS and their work illustrates how such a process architecture can link PSS developers and users in planning practice. We discuss the concepts behind MPS and use the case of Amsterdam to visualise its workings, lastly offering hypotheses on the method and suggestions for further research.},

The aim of this study was to review and identify factors that influenced an individual's on-street parking search decisions. These factors were time cost, pricing, areawide parking policy, and personal and socioeconomic characteristics. The study also examined methodological and modeling approaches applied to on-street parking searches. The paper identifies a research direction to investigate factors that influence parking search behavior across cities and countries, which will enable interspatial comparisons of influencing factors. The quantification of the economic, environmental, and safety impacts of the search for parking is a further important research area, which can be accomplished through an examination of the impact made by vehicles in search of parking, as distinct from the impact of through traffic. The findings of the present study have potential urban parking policy applications, which could reduce the number of vehicles that search for parking, with associated environmental and economic benefits.},

Decentralization relocates job sites to white suburban communities far from the CBD, and housing segregation prevents blacks from relocating their residences near the new workplaces. The purpose of the paper is to analyze an urban equilibrium with spatial mismatch. Despite the existence of a suburban employment center, blacks in the model are forced to live in the central zone they occupied in the original monocentric city, commuting across the white residential area to access suburban jobs. This 'mismatch' equilibrium is contrasted with an unrestricted equilibrium where blacks are free to locate wherever they choose.},

We provide an overview of the dimensions of unequal exposures to environmental pollution (environmental inequality), followed by a discussion of the theoretical literature that seeks to explain the origins of this phenomenon. We also consider the impact of the environmental justice movement in the United States and the role that federal and state governments have developed to address environmental inequalities. We conclude that more research is needed that links environmental inequalities with public health outcomes.},

Despite the increase in systems and users, little is known about how bikeshare member demographics and travel patterns compare with those of traditional bicyclists. To bridge the gap, this study investigated bikeshare system user travel behavior and developed a profile of user demographics through the comparison of short-term (1 day) users and annual members of Capital Bikeshare (CaBi) in Washington, D.C., with profiles of area bicyclists. Data originated from a Washington, D.C., regional household travel survey of 2007-2008, an intercept survey of short-term CaBi users, and an online survey of annual CaBi members. The analysis compared gender, race and ethnicity, age, and student status, as well as socioeconomic status across the surveys. The comparison included trip purpose, helmet use, and travel modes for trips that were replaced by bikesharing. Profiles of CaBi and area cyclists differed with respect to many demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. Compared with area cyclists, CaBi short-term users and annual members were more likely to be female and younger, to have lower household incomes, and to own fewer cars and fewer bicycles and were more likely to cycle for utilitarian purposes. CaBi trips mainly replaced trips made by public transport and by walking. CaBi short-term users and members shared similar characteristics, but short-term users were more likely to ride for recreational purposes and were less likely to wear a helmet. The study results indicated that bikesharing can encourage new segments of society to cycle and can help increase the bicycling mode share overall.},

  abstract = {The number of older Americans is predicted to increase significantly over the next 30 years. Germany has already experienced a similar challenge over recent decades. In 2005, the share of population 65 years and older was 20\% in that country, a share predicted for the United States around 2030. Both countries have among the highest motorization rates in the world, and almost all adults are licensed drivers. A comparison of the United States and Germany can provide important lessons about determinants of travel behavior of the elderly. This study traced changes in travel behavior over time in both countries using German national travel surveys from 1982 and 2002 and U. S. national travel surveys from 1983 and 2001. The study then investigated differences in determinants of travel behavior between the two countries through a multiple regression analysis based on the 2002 German travel survey and the 2001 U. S. travel survey. In both countries all social groups\textemdash but most markedly the elderly\textemdash were found to be more mobile today than 20 years ago. In both countries, travel behavior of 45 to 64 year olds in the early 1980s was a good predictor of travel behavior of 65+ year olds in 2001. Once travel behavior is adopted, it seems to carry on into older age. Besides similar trends in each country, elderly Americans were found to make more trips by car than Germans. This difference held even when controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors and spatial development patterns. Transportation policies can help explain this difference. Compared with the United States, policies in Germany make car use more expensive and particularly more difficult in cities. At the same time, public policies make cycling and public transportation easy to use, cheap, safe, convenient, and accessible transportation alternatives for a less car-dependent lifestyle into old age.},

As a growing proportion of global meat production is traded, the environmental impacts of production become increasingly separated from where the meat is consumed. In this paper, we quantify the use of three important resources associated with industrial livestock production and trade\textemdash water, land, and nitrogen\textemdash using a country-specific model that combines trade, agronomic, biogeochemical, and hydrological data. Our model focuses on pigs and chickens, as these animals are raised predominantly in intensive systems using concentrated, compound feeds. The results describe the geographical patterns of environmental resource use due to meat production, trade, and consumption. We show that US feed, animal, and meat destined for export require almost as much nitrogen and land, and 20\% more water, than products destined for domestic consumption. Model results also demonstrate that among various production factors, improvements in crop yields and animal feed conversion efficiencies result in the most significant reductions in environmental harm. By explicitly tracking the externalities of meat production, we hope to bolster suppliers' accountability and provide better information to meat consumers.},

The numbers of drivers 65 years old and older will at least double over the next 30 years.

The total amount of travel that older drivers will undertake will be much greater in 30 years, increasing 400 to 500 percent. The proportion of all driving done by older drivers will nearly triple by 2030, even according to conservative estimates. With no changes to current crash-related fatality rates, the number of fatalities involving elderly drivers in 2030 could be three to four times greater than in 1995. If this occurs, the number of elderly traffic fatalities in 2030 will be 35 to 71 percent greater than the total number of alcohol-related traffic fatalities in 1995\textemdash a fatality number now viewed by policy makers and the public as cause for serious concern. Additional public- and private-sector responses will be necessary to provide for the safe mobility of all our citizens, including new kinds of vehicles, new designs for roadways, and new forms of transportation services.

  abstract = {Racism is a fundamental cause of racial and ethnic disparities in health outcomes. Researchers have a critical role to play in confronting racism by understanding it and intervening on its impact on the health and well-being of minority populations. This requires new paradigms and theoretical frameworks that are responsive to structural racism's present-day influence on health, health disparities, and research. To address the complexity with which racism influences both health and the production of knowledge about minority populations, the field must accelerate the professional development of researchers who are committed to eliminating racial and ethnic health disparities and achieving health equity. In this commentary, we describe a unique and vital training experience, the Public Health Critical Race Praxis Institute at the University of Maryland's Center for Health Equity. Through this training institute, we have focused on the experiential knowledge of diverse researchers committed to examining racism and trained them on putting racism at the forefront of their research agendas. The Institute brought together investigators from across the United States, including junior and senior faculty as well as postdoctoral fellows. The public health critical race methodology was purposefully used to structure the Institute's curriculum, which instructed the scholars on Critical Race Theory as a framework in research. During a 2.5-day training in February 2014, scholars participated in activities, attended presentations, joined in reflections, and interacted with Institute faculty. The scholars indicated a strong desire to focus on race and racism and adopt a Public Health Critical Race Praxis framework by utilizing Critical Race Theory in their research.},

The benefits of such a policy are shown to depend on the improvement in search externalities in the on-street parking market itself, plus effects on other distorted urban transport markets, including congested freeway and backroad use, mass-transit and off-street parking. The paper makes two further contributions. The model is sufficiently general that several well-known results from the parking literature emerge as special cases. The model is used to review the existing literature and highlights findings in separate parts of literature. Finally, a numerical simulation model is used to investigate the order of magnitude of an optimal urban parking fee. In particular, these results confirm the importance of taking into accounts effects on other distorted transport markets when deciding upon the level of the price for on-street parking. The model confirms that while parking pricing reform may lead to substantial improvements in parking search times, there is little overall impact on road congestion levels.},

To this end, the research reported here focused on the role of an asymmetric intervention (a ``nudge'') in motivating choices with positive environmental outcomes. The context of this research was motivating proenvironmental food choice in campus dining halls. An experiment was conducted in which a default menu, presenting only appealing or unappealing meat-free meal options, was compared with more conventional menu configurations. The use of a default menu increased the probability that study participants would choose a meat-free meal option, and this probability increased when appealing default meal options were provided. Neither the provision of information on the menus nor the proenvironmental value orientation and worldview of participants contributed to the logistic model. These results suggest that default-based interventions can be important tools in motivating proenvironmental behavior and can serve to complement information and education efforts over the long term.},

Scott Smith 030602    While planners often see themselves as environmental enthusiasts, they cannot be assumed to sanction the protection of the natural environment (Robert Moses versus Dave Foreman of Earth First!).  Likewise, planners often claim to be defenders of the poor and of socio-economic equality however they cannot be assumed to support these social justice goals.  Campbell suggests that planners are positioned between three conflicting goals, three edges of a triangle--economic growth, environmental protection and social justice--and the conflicting axes of property (private interest vs. public good--redevelopment, gentrification), resources (nature's exploitation vs. conservation--sustained yield, subsistence wage), and development (environmental protection versus economic survival--regional rail vs. increased bus service).    The economic development planner views..  {$>$}the city as the location where production, consumption, distribution, and innovation takes place  {$>$}the city in competition with other cities and markets for new industries  {$>$}space as the economic space of highways, market areas, and commuter zones while the environmental planner sees a    the environmental planner views...  {$>$}the city as a consumer of resources and a producer of wastes  {$>$}the city in competition with nature for scarce resources and land and always poses a threat to nature  {$>$}space as the ecological space of greenways, river basins and ecological niches    the equity planner views...  {$>$}the city as a location of conflict over the distribution of resources, of services and of opportunities  {$>$}the city as being in competition with itself among different social groups  {$>$}space as the social space of communities, neighborhood organizations, labor unions: the space of access and segregation    the triangle is not only constructed of conflict but also collaboration  "trickle down economics" -- expand the economy so that society will have more wealth to distribute  "trickle down environmentalism" -- expand the economy thereby having more money with which to buy environmental protection    there is a need to combine various economic, social and environmental models in order to achieve the balance of sustainable development which lies in the center of the triangle.  it is one thing to locate sustainability in the abstract but quite another to reorganize society to get there. It is important not to set a goal so far in the future that conflicting views converge along parallel lines.  This would violate the Karl Popper's requirement that propositions be falsifiable.     "It is through resolving the three sorts of conflicts on the planner's triangle that society iteratively forms its definition of what is fair."    "the development conflict is where the real action for planners will be: seeking to resolve both environmental and economic equity issues at once.  Here is where the profession can best make its unique contribution.  An obvious start would be for community development planners and environmental planners to collaborate more."    "the trick will be for individual planners to identify their specific loyalties and roles in these conflicts accurately: that is, to orient themeselves in the triangle."},

We exploit a natural experiment of the phased implementation of a bikesharing system to different areas of New York City. This allows us to use a difference-in-differences identification strategy. We divide bus routes into control and treatment groups based on if they are located in areas that received bikesharing infrastructure or not. We find a significant decrease in bus ridership on treated routes compared to control routes that coincides with the implementation of the bikesharing system in New York City. The results from our preferred model indicate that every thousand bikesharing docks along a bus route is associated with a 2.42\% fall in daily unlinked bus trips on routes in Manhattan and Brooklyn. A second model that also controls for the expansion of bike lanes during this time suggests that the decrease in bus ridership attributable to bikesharing infrastructure alone may be smaller (a 1.69\% fall in daily unlinked bus trips). Although the magnitude of the reduction is a small proportion of total bus trips, these findings indicate that either a large proportion of overall bikeshare members are substituting bikesharing for bus trips or that bikesharing may have impacted the travel behavior of non-members, such as private bicyclists. Understanding how bikesharing and public transit systems are interrelated is vital for planning a mutually reinforcing sustainable transport network.},

Carver Terrace, an African-American community consisting mostly of homeowners, recently organized to win a federal buyout and relocation after being declared a Superfund site in 1984. Using case study evidence, the paper argues that the residents' ability to mobilize for social change was intimately linked to their adoption of an "environmental justice" frame. The intent of the conceptual discussion of environmental justice and the case study is to clarify the meaning of a term used with increasing frequency and some ambiguity in both popular and academic discourses. This paper documents the process by which the environmental justice frame is constructed in an interplay between the local community and national levels of the antitoxics movement.},

The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, which nowadays has exceeded 2.5 million notified infections in the world and about 200,000 deaths, is a strong reminder that urbanization has changed the way that people and communities live, work, and interact, and it's necessary to make the systems and local capacities resilient to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. How we can re-design the concept of Public Health in relation to the built environment and the contemporary cities? Methods. According to the previous statements and scenario, aim of this paper is to integrate the Urban Health strategic objectives, focusing the possible responses, both immediate and medium-long term, to the current environmental, social, and economic aspects of the ``period'' of physical distancing. Results. Immediate Actions are 01. program the flexibility of city schedules; 02. plan a smart and sustainable mobility network; 03. define a neighborhood services' plan; 04. develop a digitization of the urban context, promoting the smart communities; 05. re-think the accessibility to the places of culture and tourism. Medium-long term Actions are 06. design the indoor flexibility of domestic living spaces; 07. re-think building typologies, fostering the presence of semi-private or collective spaces; 08. renovate the basic care services' network; 09. integrate the existing environmental emergency plans, with those related to the health emergencies; 10. improve stakeholders' awareness of the factors affecting Public Health in the cities. Conclusions. The Decalogue of Public Health opportunities may provide a useful basis for Designers (Architects and Urban Planners), Policy Makers, Public Health experts and Local Health Agencies, in promoting actions and policies aimed to transform our cities in healthier and Salutogenic living environments.

Ten key points have been formulated: 1. climate change and management of adverse weather events; 2. land consumption, sprawl, and shrinking cities; 3. tactical urbanism and urban resilience; 4. urban comfort, safety, and security perception; 5. strengths and weaknesses of urban green areas and infrastructures; 6. urban solid waste management; 7. housing emergencies in relation to socio-economic and environmental changes; 8. energy aspects and environmental planning at an urban scale; 9. socio-assistance and welfare network at an urban scale: importance of a rational and widespread system; and 10. new forms of living, conscious of coparticipation models and aware of sharing quality objectives. Design strategies, actions, and policies, identified to improve public health and wellbeing, underline that the connection between morphological and functional features of urban context and public health is crucial for contemporary cities and modern societies.},

Methods Participants (N=690) were from 380 census block groups of high/low walkability and income in two US regions. Home neighborhood residential density, intersection density, retail density, entertainment density and walkability were derived using GIS. Minutes/day of walking, bicycling and vehicle time were derived from processing algorithms applied to GPS. Accelerometers estimated total daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Models were adjusted for nesting of days (N=2987) within participants within block groups. Results Walking occurred on 33\%, active travel on 43\%, and vehicle time on 91\% of the days observed. Intersection density and neighborhood walkability were positively related to walking and bicycling and negatively related to vehicle time. Residential density was positively related to walking. Conclusions Increasing walking in youth could be effective in increasing total physical activity. Built environment findings suggest potential for increasing walking in youth through improving neighborhood walkability.},

  abstract = {One explanation for high unemployment rates and low earnings among African American and other low-wage inner-city workers is that these workers are geographically isolated from emerging employment centers. This argument, commonly known as the spatial-mismatch hypothesis, rests on two assumptions. The first is that residents of inner-city high-poverty neighborhoods have fewer job opportunities available to them than do residents of other neighborhoods. The second is that this mismatch negatively affects employment outcomes. However, research on spatial mismatch has focused primarily on the relation between job opportunities and employment outcomes without first establishing the correlation between neighborhood residence and job availability. In this paper, we examine the relationship between neighborhood residence and job opportunities for neighborhoods in the city of Chicago and find that residents of African American neighborhoods have reduced access to jobs, whereas those residing in high-poverty neighborhoods are not necessarily faced with diminished opportunities. However, this reduced access to jobs has a smaller-than-expected effect on employment outcomes.},

Usually users are required only to have access to sophisticated and powerful computer equipment and peripherals to use effectively such contemporary offerings. The range of electronic displays used for spatial information visualization can be enlarged through the application of other available devices, from domestic televisions to Internet services, making it possible to access spatial information in ways and with equipment that is familiar. However, many users may be unable to comprehend the real information being displayed with these new tools due to a lack of "ground truthing". "Ground truthing" in this context refers to additional data and information that ensure that the user, especially the novice, appreciates that depicted phenomena are real and do occur at some actual location and at some point of time. "Ground truthing" of the depiction of spatial information may be achieved by linking electronic map displays to "real" locations through the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web. This paper gives an overview of the various types of products that could be developed for the delivery of spatial information in a different manner that complements the methods now in popular use and proposes the use of projects on CD-ROM and the World Wide Web that could be linked to mapping displays to provide "electronic ground truthing".},

Our algorithm starts from a subset of outlier-free observations and then selects additional observations according to their degree of agreement with the postulated model. A number of useful diagnostics which are monitored along the search help to identify masked spatial outliers and high leverage sites. In contrast to other robust techniques, our method is particularly suited for the analysis of complex multidimensional systems since each step is performed through statistically and computationally efficient procedures, such as maximum likelihood. The main contribution of this paper is the development of joint robust estimation of both trend and autocorrelation parameters in spatial linear models. For this purpose we suggest a novel definition of the elemental sets of the Forward Search, which relies on blocks of contiguous spatial locations.},

  abstract = {Shifts in job accessibility reflect, in part, the degree to which land use and transportation decisions are helping to economize on commuting and promote social equality objectives. This paper argues for the aggressive use of accessibility indicators as part of the long-range transportation planning process. As a case example, changes in job accessibility indices are traced for the San Francisco Bay Area from 1980 to 1990, computed for 100 residential areas and the region's 22 largest employment centers. The indices were refined based on occupational match indicators that weighed the consistency between residents' employment roles and labor force occupational characteristics at workplaces. The analysis revealed that peripheral areas tended to be the least job accessible. Moreover, employment centers that are home to highly skilled professional workers were generally the most accessible when occupational matching is accounted for. This was interpreted to reflect the existence of a more robust and responsive housing market in and around higher end employment centers. Our analyses also revealed that residents of low income, inner-city neighborhoods generally faced the greatest occupational mismatches. Through a path analysis, racial discrimination was found to be a more serious obstacle to employment than job accessibility, however. We conclude that the very purpose of tracking change sin accessibility is to provide feedback on the degree to which resource allocation decisions in the urban transportation field are helping to redress serious inequities in accessibility to jobs, medical facilities, and other important destinations.},

  abstract = {The San Francisco Bay Area has taken on a distinct polycentric metropolitan form, with three tiers of hierarchical employment centers encircling downtown San Francisco, the region's primary center. In this paper it is found that polycentric development is associated with differentials in suburban and urban commute trip times: commute trips made by employees of suburban centers are shorter in duration than commute trips made by their counterparts in larger and denser urban centers. Differentials were even greater, however, with respect to commuting modal splits. Lower density, outlying employment centers averaged far higher rates of drive-alone automobile commuting and insignificant levels of transit commuting. Smaller, outlying centers were also the least self-contained, with a large number averaging twenty or more times as many external as internal commutes. The effects of housing availability and prices on the residential locational choices of those working in both urban and suburban employment centers are also investigated in this paper. Locational choices are stratified by occupational class and type of center. High housing prices in and around employment centers were found to displace workers to residences in other subregions, except in the case of professional workers in fast-growing, outlying centers. These workers were attracted to higher-priced nearby housing. In the empirical analysis significant segmentation in housing choices among workers in fast-growing suburban centers was found. This could be partly due to selective land-use policies implemented by local governments in these areas.},

  abstract = {Around the world, mass transit is struggling to compete with the private automobile, and in many places, its market share is rapidly eroding. Yet a number of metropolitan areas have in recent decades managed to mount cost-effective and resource-conserving transit services that provide respectable alternatives to car travel. What sets these places apart?   In this book, noted transportation expert Robert Cervero provides an on-the-ground look at more than a dozen mass transit success stories, introducing the concept of the "transit metropolis"\textemdash a region where a workable fit exists between transit services and urban form. The author has spent more than three years studying cities around the world, and he makes a compelling case that metropolitan areas of any size and with any growth pattern\textemdash from highly compact to widely dispersed\textemdash can develop successful mass transit systems.   Following an introductory chapter that frames his argument and outlines the main issues, Cervero describes and examines five different types of transit metropolises, with twelve in-depth case studies of cities that represent each type. He considers the key lessons of the case studies and debunks widely held myths about transit and the city. In addition, he reviews the efforts underway in five North American cities to mount transit programs and discusses the factors working for and against their success. Cities profiled include Stockholm; Singapore; Tokyo; Ottawa; Zurich; Melbourne; Mexico City; Curitiba, Brazil; Portland, Oregon; and Vancouver, British Columbia.   The Transit Metropolis provides practical lessons on how North American cities can manage sprawl and haphazard highway development by creating successful mass transit systems. While many books discuss the need for a sustainable transportation system, few are able to present examples of successful systems and provide the methods and tools needed to create such a system. This book is a unique and invaluable resource for transportation planners and professionals, urban planners and designers, policymakers and students of planning and urban design.},

  abstract = {Multicriteria analysis is a set of mathematical tools and methods allowing the comparison of different alternatives according to many criteria, often conflicting, to guide the decision maker towards a judicious choice. Multicriteria methods are used in spatial context to evaluate and compare spatial decision alternatives, often modeled through constraint-based suitability analysis and represented by point, line, and polygon features or their combination, and evaluated on several space-related criteria, to select a restricted subset for implementation. Outranking methods, a family of multicriteria methods, may be useful in spatial decision problems, especially when ordinal evaluation criteria are implied. However, it is recognized that these methods, except those devoted to multicriteria classification problems, are subject to computational limitations with respect to the number of alternatives. This paper proposes a framework to facilitate the incorporation and use of outranking methods in geographical information systems (GIS). The framework is composed of two phases. The first phase allows producing a planar subdivision of the study area obtained by combining a set of criteria maps; each represents a particular vision of the decision problem. The result is a set of non-overlapping spatial units. The second phase allows constructing decision alternatives by combining the spatial units. Point, line and polygon feature-based decision alternatives are then constructed as an individual, a grouping of linearly adjacent or a grouping of contiguous spatial units. This permits us to reduce considerably the number of alternatives, enabling the use of outranking methods. The framework is illustrated through the development of a prototype and through a step-by-step application to a corridor identification problem. This paper includes also a discussion of some conceptual and technical issues related to the framework.},

Taking into account the present days typical urban configurations, three principal flow regimes ``isolated roughness flow'', ``skimming flow'' and ``wake interference flow'' (Boundary Layer Climates, 2nd edition, Methuen, London) and their corresponding pollutant dispersion characteristics are studied for various canopies aspect ratios, namely relative height (h2/h1), canyon height to width ratio (h/w) and canyon length to height ratio (l/h). A field-size canyon has been analyzed through numerical simulations using the standard k-{$\epsilon$} turbulence closure model. It is found that the pollutant transport and diffusion is strongly dependent upon the type of flow regime inside the canyon and exchange between canyon and the above roof air. Some rules of thumbs have been established to get urban canyon geometries for efficient dispersion of pollutants.},

This article uses in-depth interviews with 92 women on welfare in San Francisco, as well as a binomial logit model, to examine the relationship between job search strategies and employment characteristics. The findings suggest that low-income women with children are more likely to rely on contacts than women without children, because they seek to work close to home. For most women, building connections to employers, improving human capital, and increasing the density of neighborhood economic and social activity will make jobs more accessible.},

The interviews were held with residents of 12 towns and cities in England that were experiencing an unprecedented scale of investment in cycling by UK standards. The interviews collected biographical information on travel behaviour life circumstances and probed the reasons for changes in cycling. Theory and preliminary analysis were used to develop a conceptual model which posits that turning points in cycling behaviour are triggered by contextual change and mediated by intrinsic motivations, facilitating conditions and personal history. It is shown that life events were usually the trigger for a change in cycling but external changes to the bicycle environment played a facilitating role in enabling change. The types of life events that were relevant varied over the age span of participants. Practitioners can take advantage of the life events identified as opportunities to promote cycling.},

  abstract = {Record matching is the task of identifying records that match the same real world entity. This is a problem of great significance for a variety of business intelligence applications. Implementations of record matching rely on exact as well as approximate string matching (e.g., edit distances) and use of external reference data sources. Record matching can be viewed as a query composed of a small set of primitive operators. However, formulating such record matching queries is difficult and depends on the specific application scenario. Specifically, the number of options both in terms of string matching operations as well as the choice of external sources can be daunting. In this paper, we exploit the availability of positive and negative examples to search through this space and suggest an initial record matching query. Such queries can be subsequently modified by the programmer as needed. We ensure that the record matching queries our approach produces are (1) efficient: these queries can be run on large datasets by leveraging operations that are well-supported by RDBMSs, and (2) explainable: the queries are easy to understand so that they may be modified by the programmer with relative ease. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several real-world datasets.},

Participants Subsample of 4507 adults aged 16+ were selected for accelerometry wear, of whom 2115 adults had valid accelerometry data wear (with at least 600 min per day). Main Outcome Measure Prevalence of those adults who meet the current physical activity (PA) recommendations by accelerometry data. Mean sedentary (minutes) and MVPA minutes (accelerometry). Results Based on accelerometry data, 6\% of men and 4\% of women met the Chief Medical Officer's current minimum recommendations for PA by achieving at least 30 min of moderate or vigorous activity on at least 5 days in the week of accelerometer wear. Men and women aged 16\textendash 34 were most likely to have met the recommendations (11\% and 8\%, respectively). In contrast, based on self-report measures, 39\% of men and 29\% of women were said to have met the PA recommendations. Only 10\% of men and 8\% of women whose self-reported activity level corresponded with meeting the recommendations also met the recommendations based on accelerometry. Overall, men had significantly longer periods of sedentary time per day than women (595 min and 584 min, respectively), (p=0.003). While men spent an average of 31 min in MVPA in total per day, and women an average of 24 min, most of this was sporadic activity. Those who were not overweight or obese spent few minutes on average in sedentary time (591 min for men and 577 min for women) than those who were obese (612 min for men and 585 for women). Similarly, adults not overweight or obese spent more MVPA minutes than those who were overweight or obese. This pattern was similar with each BMI category. Conclusion Subjective self-reported method of assessing physical activity resulted in higher levels of activity than objective accelerometry data. Despite this, the results from objective accelerometer data corroborate self-report findings across age and sex. Objective measures provide more accurate data and should be used where available. Comparison between objective and subjective methods indicates that people over estimate their actual physical activity levels.},

Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City, I define a process I refer to as ``environmental gentrification,'' which builds on the material and discursive successes of the environmental justice movement and appropriates them to serve high-end development. While it appears as politically-neutral, consensus-based planning that is both ecologically and socially sensitive, in practice, environmental gentrification subordinates equity to profit-minded development. I propose that this process offers a new way of exploring the paradoxes and conundrums facing contemporary urban residents as they fight to challenge the vast economic and ecological disparities that increasingly divide today's cities.},

Main Outcome Measures: Rates, rate differences, and rate ratios of COVID-19 mortality, confirmed cases, and positive tests by category of county and zip code\textendash level area-based socioeconomic measures.  Results: As of May 5, 2020, the COVID-19 death rate per 100 000 person-years equaled the following: 143.2 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 140.9, 145.5) vs 83.3 (95\% CI: 78.3, 88.4) in high versus low poverty counties ({$\geq$}20\% vs {$<$}5\% of persons below poverty); 124.4 (95\% CI: 122.7, 126.0) versus 48.2 (95\% CI: 47.2, 49.2) in counties in the top versus bottom quintile for household crowding; and 127.7 (95\% CI: 126.0, 129.4) versus 25.9 (95\% CI: 25.1, 26.6) for counties in the top versus bottom quintile for the percentage of persons who are people of color. Socioeconomic gradients in Illinois confirmed cases and New York City positive tests by zip code\textendash level area-based socioeconomic measures were also observed.  Conclusions: Stark social inequities exist in the United States for COVID-19 outcomes. We recommend that public health departments use these straightforward cost-effective methods to report on social inequities in COVID-19 outcomes to provide an evidence base for policy and resource allocation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an ensemble learning approach for better understanding ridesplitting behavior of passengers of ridesourcing companies who provide prearranged and on-demand transportation services. An ensemble learning model is a weighted combination of multiple classification models or week classifiers to form a strong classification model. The goal of ensemble learning is to combine decisions or predictions of several base classifiers to improve prediction, generalizability, and robustness over a single classifier. This paper employs the Boosting ensemble by growing individual decision trees sequentially and then assembling these trees to produce a powerful classification model. To improve the prediction accuracy of ridesplitting choices, we explored real-world individual level data extracted from the on-demand ride service platform of DiDi in Hangzhou, China. Over one million trips of the four service types, i.e., Taxi Hailing Service, Express, Private Car Service, and Hitch, are explored with descriptive statistics. A variety of features that may impact ridesplitting behavior are ranked and selected by using the ReliefF algorithm, such as trip travel time, trip costs, trip length, waiting time fee, travel time reliability of origins/destinations and so on. The Boosting ensemble trees with full features and selected features are trained and validated using two independent datasets. This paper also verifies that ensemble learning is particularly useful and powerful in the ridesplitting analysis and outperforms three other widely used classifiers. This paper is one of the first quantitative studies that empirically reveal the real-world demand and supply pattern by exploring the city-wide data of an on-demand ride service platform.},

One prominent example of flexible work is the ride-sharing company Uber, which allows drivers to provide (or not provide) rides anytime they are willing to accept prevailing wages for providing this service. An Uber-style arrangement offers workers flexibility in both setting a customized work schedule and also adjusting the schedule from week to week, day to day, and hour to hour. Using data on hourly earnings for Uber drivers, we document the ways in which drivers utilize this real-time flexibility and we estimate the driver surplus generated by this flexibility. We estimate how drivers' reservation wages vary from hour to hour, which allows us to examine the surplus and supply implications of both flexible and traditional work arrangements. Our results indicate that, while the Uber relationship may have other drawbacks, Uber drivers benefit significantly from real-time flexibility, earning more than twice the surplus they would in less flexible arrangements. If required to supply labor inflexibly at prevailing wages, they would also reduce the hours they supply by more than two-thirds.},

  abstract = {The state of California is expected to have significant population growth in the next half-century resulting in additional passenger transportation demand. Planning for a high-speed rail system connecting San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Sacramento as well as many population centers between is now underway. The considerable investment in California high-speed rail has been debated for some time and now includes the energy and environmental tradeoffs. The per-trip energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and other emissions are often compared against the alternatives (automobiles, heavy rail, and aircraft), but typically only considering vehicle operation. An environmental life-cycle assessment of the four modes was created to compare both direct effects of vehicle operation and indirect effects from vehicle, infrastructure, and fuel components. Energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and SO2, CO, NOX , VOC, and PM10 emissions were evaluated. The energy and emission intensities of each mode were normalized per passenger kilometer traveled by using high and low occupancies to illustrate the range in modal environmental performance at potential ridership levels. While high-speed rail has the potential to be the lowest energy consumer and greenhouse gas emitter, appropriate planning and continued investment would be needed to ensure sustained high occupancy. The time to environmental payback is discussed highlighting the ridership conditions where high-speed rail will or will not produce fewer environmental burdens than existing modes. Furthermore, environmental tradeoffs may occur. High-speed rail may lower energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions per trip but can create more SO2 emissions (given the current electricity mix) leading to environmental acidification and human health issues. The significance of life-cycle inventorying is discussed as well as the potential of increasing occupancy on mass transit modes.},

Because the website of Airbnb has started from 2010 in Korea and has a low awareness, it has a less effect in Korea. The listing of Airbnb is rapidly growing in 2014. Given that the data of 2014 adds to the study, the result can be changed. Second, the estimate of the unemployment rate is strongly significant. If unemployment rate increases, the demand for hotel decreases. Because unemployment rate explains the present economic situation, the increase of the unemployment rate can imply a recession and the decrease of the trip can be followed. Third, the exchange rate has a positive effect on the hotel revenue, especially in Jeju. When the exchange rate is higher, the tourists from the abroad increase, and thus hotel revenue can increase. It implies that the tourists sensitively respond to the exchange rate. Forth, the estimates of the vacation dummy variable are strongly significant in Busan and Jeju. There is a ton of tourists in the holiday (especially summer) season, and thus it is common in the increase in the hotel revenue during this season.},

  abstract = {Rationale: The biological mechanisms linking air pollution to cardiovascular events still remain largerly unclear. Objectives: To investigate whether biological mechanisms linking air pollution to cardiovascular events occurred concurrently in human subjects exposed to urban air pollutants. Methods: We recruited a panel of 76 young, healthy students from a university in Taipei. Between April and June of 2004 or 2005, three measurements were made in each participant of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), 8-hydroxy-2{${'}$}-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), plasminogen activator fibrinogen inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in plasma, and heart rate variability (HRV). Gaseous air pollutants were measured at one air-monitoring station inside their campus, and particulate air pollutants were measured at one particulate matter supersite monitoring station 1 km from their campus. We used linear mixed-effects models to associate biological endpoints with individual air pollutants averaged over 1- to 3-day periods before measurements were performed. Measurements and Main Results: We found that increases in hs-CRP, 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and decreases in HRV indices were associated with increases in levels of particles with aerodynamic diameters less than 10 {$\mu$}m and 2.5 {$\mu$}m, sulfate, nitrate, and ozone (O3) in single-pollutant models. The increase in 8-OHdG, fibrinogen, and PAI-1, and the reduction in HRV remained significantly associated with 3-day averaged sulfate and O3 levels in two-pollutant models. There were moderate correlations (r = -0.3) between blood markers of hs-CRP, fibrinogen, PAI-1, and HRV indices. Conclusions: Urban air pollution is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress, blood coagulation and autonomic dysfunction simultaneously in healthy young humans, with sulfate and O3 as two major traffic-related pollutants contributing to such effects.},

A meta-analysis of the studies dealing with retail food waste quantification is provided to identify the results obtained so far. Then, the mass and value of food waste produced in 2015 at one retail store in Italy is analysed, basing on the store's food waste records and on the reports of a redistribution initiative involving the edible fraction of the food waste produced. In one year, 70.6 tons of food (for a value of nearly 170,000 \texteuro ) are wasted, mostly bread and fresh fruit and vegetables. The edible fraction accounts for 35\% of the total food waste, mostly from fresh meat and bakery departments. Results also disclose a significant amount of unrecorded food waste, confirming that many gaps exist in the food waste recording procedure at retail stores.},

  abstract = {With walkable, mixed-use real estate now in high demand as an economic engine for cities, metropolitan governments are reexamining how to build productive, resilient urban places to attract young talent, aging demographics, and new employment sectors. A crucial factor in their development is diversity\textemdash not just diversity of residents, but in housing, transportation, and workplace choices. Missing Middle Housing, developed by CNU member Dan Parolek and Opticos Design, is an initiative designed to confront and help remedy a serious market gap in many walkable urban places. Missing Middle is a range of multi-unit or clustered housing types compatible in scale with single-family homes that help meet the growing demand for walkable urban living. These types provide diverse housing options along a spectrum of affordability, including duplexes, fourplexes, and bungalow courts, to support walkable communities, locally-serving retail, and public transportation options. Missing Middle Housing provides a solution to the mismatch between the available U.S. housing stock and shifting demographics combined with the growing demand for walkability. Diagram of Missing Middle Housing Types. Source: Opticos Design, Inc. This website is designed to serve as a collective resource for planners and developers seeking to implement Missing Middle projects. You will find clear definitions of the types of mid-density housing that are best for creating walkable neighborhoods, as well as information on the unifying characteristics of these building types. The website also offers information on how to integrate Missing Middle Housing into existing neighborhoods, explains how to regulate these building types, and pin-points the market demographic that demands them.

The interconnectivity of an urban network represents how well different services integrate to offer seamless transportation options to users. On the supply side, we leverage open data sources that cities provide to accurately model the services that they offer. On the demand side, we account for myopic user behavior through the use of journey planners and travel demand estimates. The reciprocal interaction between supply and demand is then used to characterize interconnectivity. In a multi-modal setting, we present different measures that can be employed to understand shortcomings in connectivity across the network. Using these metrics, improvements in service schedules are proposed using an optimization model that seeks to perturb existing schedules to improve transit connectivity. Real-world data from Washington, D.C. is used to demonstrate presented measures and optimal schedule perturbation for one route are presented which result in a 19\% reduction in delays.},

But how to fight that war is still under discussion. The hastily introduced measures vary widely between countries and even within countries. That reflects different phases of the epidemic, as well as differences in resources, cultures, governments, and laws. And there's also confusion about what works best, and how to balance what is necessary with what is reasonable. Lockdowns and closings proliferate, but virus testing and contact tracing are lagging.

While co-owning properties has been widely accepted for a while (e.g., timeshares), the notion of sharing bikes, cars, or even rides on an on-demand basis is just now starting to gain widespread popularity. The emerging ``sharing economy'' is particularly interesting in the context of cities that struggle with population growth and increasing density. While sharing vehicles promises to reduce inner-city traffic, congestion, and pollution problems, the associated business models are not without problems themselves. Using agency theory, in this article we discuss existing shared mobility business models in an effort to unveil the optimal relationship between service providers (agents) and the local governments (principals) to achieve the common objective of sustainable mobility. Our findings show private or public models are fraught with conflicts, and point to a merit model as the most promising alignment of the strengths of agents and principals.},

We combine unique, census-tract level data from Airbnb with neighborhood asking rent data from Zillow and administrative, census, and social media data on neighborhoods. We find that as usage has grown over time, Airbnb listings have become more geographically dispersed, although centrality remains an important predictor of listing location.  Neighborhoods with more modest median household incomes have also grown in popularity, and disproportionately feature ``private room'' listings (compared to ``entire home'' listings). We find that compared to long-term rentals, short-term rentals do not appear to be as profitable as many assume, and they have become relatively less profitable over our time period. Additionally, short-term rentals appear most profitable relative to long-term rentals in outlying, middle-income neighborhoods. Our findings contribute to an ongoing regulatory conversation catalyzed by the rapid growth in the short-term rental market, and we conclude by bringing an economic lens to varying approaches proposed to target and address externalities that may arise in this market.},

Results reveal better living conditions and socioeconomic improvements derived from higher resource throughput but without complete disregard to environmental issues. Food intake, water consumption and air emissions remained at similar levels; energy use, construction materials and recycled waste were increased.

  abstract = {Interstate elderly migration has strong implications for state tax policies and health care systems, yet little is known about how it has changed in the twenty-first century. Its relative rarity requires a large data set with which to construct reliable measures, and the replacement of the U.S. Census long form (CLF) with the American Community Survey (ACS) has made such updates difficult. Two commonly used alternative migration data sources\textemdash the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Statistics of Income (SOI) program of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\textemdash suffer serious limitations in studying the migration of any subpopulation, including the elderly. Our study informs migration research in the post-2000 era by identifying methodological differences between data sources and devising strategies for reconciling the CLF and ACS. Our investigation focusing on the elderly suggests that the ACS can generate comparable migration data that reveal a continuation of previously identified geographic patterns as well as changes unique to the 2000s. However, its changed definition of residence and survey timing leaves us unable to construct a comparable national migration rate, suggesting that one must use national trends in the smaller CPS to investigate whether elderly migration has increased or decreased in the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Solid waste management in the United States is one urban practice that provides evidence for, and reinforces Marx's theory of urban ``metabolic rift.'' However, urban planners as a field have historically shifted the onus for solid waste issues to engineers and private citizens. By avoiding waste, planners have dismissed a basic portion of their responsibility to the public and violated their own code of ethics. Repairing the metabolic balance of cities is admittedly a colossal undertaking. It will be necessary for planners to once again pay attention to the sub-field that spawned their profession, but this time through an updated frame, or mode of interpreting reality. In the course of this project, I uncover frames that have been employed by planners in the past and the effects these frames have had for solid waste management. Finding that rational positivist, grassroots communitarian, and insurgent radical frames have not adequately addressed the chronic symptoms of our metabolic rift, I analyze and adapt a frame for planning, the biotechnic frame, which is based on Sir Patrick Geddes' theory of technics and civics. Finally, in order to test an innovative sustainable solid waste management technology that holds promise for repairing the metabolic rift, I evaluate the practice of landfill mining to determine whether or not it fits within a biotechnic frame.  This study shows that waste is a frame, or mode of understanding conditions, not an inevitability. Rather than solid waste sitting untouched in landfills, it can be reintegrated into the material and energy flows of the city-region, helping to balance the urban metabolism and ``close the loop'' on a historically linear waste cycle. With the appropriate frame, planners are especially equipped to facilitate this change.},

  abstract = {This research tests the spatial mismatch hypothesis by comparing the employment probabilities of central city versus suburban African American males in nine metropolitan areas. Treatment effects models are used to control for the effects of both individual characteristics and residential self-selection on the probability of employment. A positive effect of suburban residential location on employment is found for the residents of Dallas, Los Angeles, New York, and Washington, while no effect is found for the residents of Cleveland, Houston, Jackson, Memphis, and Newark. The general conclusion to be drawn is that the spatial mismatch effect is contingent on the particular characteristics of each metropolitan area. Preliminary analysis shows that metropolitan areas with a spatial mismatch effect are large in terms of total population and total land area, and have less efficient transportation systems.},

  abstract = {The spatial-mismatch hypothesis argues that African American labor-force participation is reduced by African Americans' inability to gain access to relatively distant suburban job opportunities. A significant limitation of the mismatch literature is that it has failed to recognize that a number of factors associated with gender may intereact with race-based constraints on access to job opportunities to mediate the mismatch effect. The purpose of this exploratory research is to investigate how the relationship between geographic access to job opportunities and labor-force participation is influenced by the interaction of both race and gender in the greater Boston metropolitan area using data from the 5\% Public Use Microdata Sample of the 1990 US Census. The results indicate that proximity to intra-metropolotan job opportunities has no effect on African American labor-force participation, but that it has a positive effect on labor-force participation among White married mothers. These findings demonstrate the need for continued research that will more finely analyze how race, gender, and metropolitan characteristics intersect to determine how jobs and workers are matched to each other within a metropolitan labor market.},

Rorty's assertions of the contingency of language, society and self are explored. Under the contingency of language, the figure of the ironist is defined, and Rorty's conception of vocabularies is discussed. Under the contingency of society, Rorty's definition of liberalism, his opposition of literary culture to materialist and metaphysical culture, and his notions concerning utopian politics are discussed. Under the contingency of self, Rorty's critique of Kantian and his appropriations of Deweyan and Freudian conceptions of morality are presented. Other key factors discussed are Rorty's theory of the separation of the private and public spheres of life and his ideas concerning cruelty and human solidarity. In this way, a critical analysis of Rorty's proposed balance between private, ironic doubt and public, liberal social hope is presented and assessed in terms of its merit as a system of thought suited to the needs of post-metaphysical, liberal societies.},

  abstract = {The informal settlements of the Global South are the least prepared for the pandemic of COVID-19 since basic needs such as water, toilets, sewers, drainage, waste collection, and secure and adequate housing are already in short supply or non-existent. Further, space constraints, violence, and overcrowding in slums make physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, and the rapid spread of an infection highly likely. Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care. Lessons have been learned from earlier pandemics such as HIV and epidemics such as Ebola. They can be applied here. At the same time, the opportunity exists for public health, public administration, international aid, NGOs, and community groups to innovate beyond disaster response and move toward long-term plans.},

This paper aims to offer a method for estimating the distribution of air toxics in urban neighborhoods using land use information because actual air monitoring data rarely exist at this scale. Using Geographic Information System spatial modeling tools, we estimate air toxics concentrations across neighborhoods in New York City and statistically compare our model with the US Environmental Protection Agency's National Air Toxic Assessment and air monitoring data across three NYC neighborhoods. We conclude that land use data can act as a good proxy for estimating neighborhood scale air toxics, particularly in the absence of monitoring data. In addition, the paper suggests that land use data can expand the reach of environmental impact assessments that routinely exclude analyses of potential exposures to urban air toxics at the neighborhood scale.},

News reports showed pictures of long lines of voters due to fewer polling locations and suggested that the election may further the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A contact-tracing analysis by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services identified 71 confirmed cases of COVID-19 to in-person voting, but no research has conducted a broader analysis of the extent to which in-person voting increased the number of COVID-19 cases. We use county level data on voting and COVID-19 tests to connect the election to the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We find a statistically and economically significant association between in-person voting and the spread of COVID-19 two to three weeks after the election. Results indicate that on average a 10\% difference in in-person voters per polling location between counties is associated with approximately a 17.7\% increase in the positive test rate. Further, extrapolation of estimates from the average county suggests that in-person voting was related to approximately 700 more COVID-19 cases in Wisconsin during the weeks following the election, or about 7.7\% of the total number of confirmed cases during the five week post-treatment time period studied.},

In contrast with traditional environmental health approaches that focus primarily on toxic substances in air, water, and soil, this more recent approach conceptualizes the environment more broadly to encompass a range of human-made physical and social features that are affected by public policy (Frumkin, 2005). These economic, social, urban or rural, transportation, and other policies that affect the environment were not traditionally thought of as relevant to health policy but are now attracting greater attention because decision makers are beginning to recognize their health implications (Cole and Fielding, 2007).},

We used the Illinois State Trauma Registry (1999\textendash 2009).

We used multivariate regression to calculate the effect on mortality of being shot more than 5 miles from a trauma center.Results. Of 11\,744 GSW patients during the study period, 4782 were shot more than 5 miles from a trauma center. Mean transport time and unadjusted mortality were higher for these patients (P\,{$<$}\,.001 for both). In a multivariate model, suffering a GSW more than 5 miles from a trauma center was associated with an increased risk of death (odds ratio\,=\,1.23; 95\% confidence interval\,=\,1.02, 1.47; P\,=\,.03).Conclusions. Relative ``trauma deserts'' with decreased access to immediate care were found in certain areas of Chicago and adversely affected mortality from GSWs.

In 1900, the U.S. sent three doctors to Cuba to discover how yellow fever was spread. There, they launched one of history's most controversial human studies. Compelling and terrifying, The American Plague depicts the story of yellow fever and its reign in this country\textemdash and in Africa, where even today it strikes thousands every year.

  abstract = {Travis Hugh Culley came to Chicago to work and live as an artist. He knew he'd have to struggle, but he found that his struggle meant more than hard work and a taste for poverty. In becoming a bike messenger, he found a sense of community and fulfillment and a brotherhood of like-minded individualists. He rode like a postmodern cowboy across the city's landscape; he passed like a shadow through its soaring office towers; he soared like a falcon through the roaring chaos of the multilayered streets of Chicago. He became an invisible man in society, yet at the same time its most intimate observer. In one of the most dangerous jobs on dry land, he found freedom. In The Immortal Class, Culley takes us in-side the heart and soul of an urban icon the bicycle messenger. In describing his own history and those of his peers, he evokes a classic American maverick, deeply woven into the fabric of society from the pits of squalor to the highest reaches of power and privilege yet always resolutely, exuberantly outside. And he celebrates a culture that eschews the motorized vehicle: the cult of human power. The Immortal Class, Culley's vivid evocation of a bicycle messenger's experience and philosophy, sheds a compelling light on the way human beings relate to one another and to the cities we inhabit. Travis Hugh Culley's voice is at once earthy and soaringly poetic a Gen-X Tom Joad at hyperspeed. The Immortal Class is a unique personal and political narrative of a cyclist's life on the street.From the Hardcover edition.},

It incorporates relevant outputs from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) Urban Regeneration and the Environment (URGENT) research programme and from research directly commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM). It supports three principal planning functions carried out by local authorities: pre-planning enquiries, development control decisions and strategic planning. Eleven environmental science themes are incorporated: Air quality, Shallow undermining, Landslide susceptibility, Groundwater protection, Flood risk, Drainage, Land contamination, Proximity to landfill, Biodiversity, Natural and Man-made heritage. Decision flow diagrams represent detailed analysis of workflow in each theme, taking account of best practice, regulatory responsibilities and planning guidance. Industry-standard web technologies integrate the flows and provide access to the system via secure web pages. Underpinning the system is an environmental geographical information system (GIS) containing up-to-date data, information and models relevant to each theme. The modular system design allows new legislation and local priorities and datasets to be easily incorporated. Web technology delivers information and research data that have hitherto been difficult for the non-specialist to access and have therefore been under-exploited. The study has demonstrated a successful application of the principles of e-Governance in an area where informed decisions commonly require specialist information. The system, if rolled out nationally, offers potential economic benefits and efficiency savings for both planners and developers.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the question of sampling (or selection of cases) in qualitative research. Although the literature includes some very useful discussions of qualitative sampling strategies, the question of sampling often seems to receive less attention in methodological discussion than questions of how data is collected or is analysed. Decisions about sampling are likely to be important in many qualitative studies (although it may not be an issue in some research). There are varying accounts of the principles applicable to sampling or case selection. Those who espouse `theoretical sampling', based on a `grounded theory' approach, are in some ways opposed to those who promote forms of `purposive sampling' suitable for research informed by an existing body of social theory. Diversity also results from the many different methods for drawing purposive samples which are applicable to qualitative research. We explore the value of a framework suggested by Miles and Huberman [Miles, M., Huberman,, A., 1994. Qualitative Data Analysis, Sage, London.], to evaluate the sampling strategies employed in three examples of research by the authors. Our examples comprise three studies which respectively involve selection of: `healing places'; rural places which incorporated national anti-malarial policies; young male interviewees, identified as either chronically ill or disabled. The examples are used to show how in these three studies the (sometimes conflicting) requirements of the different criteria were resolved, as well as the potential and constraints placed on the research by the selection decisions which were made. We also consider how far the criteria Miles and Huberman suggest seem helpful for planning `sample' selection in qualitative research.

The association between the presence of facilities and socioeconomic characteristics of places are examined for the state of South Carolina at three different spatial scales: counties, census tracts, and census block groups. Three different types of hazardous waste/toxic facilities are also examined: Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) sites, Treatment, Storage, and Disposal sites (TSD), and inactive hazardous waste sites. At the county level, there was some association between the presence of toxic/hazardous waste facilities and race and income. In South Carolina, this translates to a disproportionate burden on White, more affluent communities in metropolitan areas, rather than low income minority communities. At both the census tract and block group levels, there is no association between race and the location of toxic/hazardous waste facilities. There are slight differences in the income levels between tracts and block groups with facilities and those without. This localized ecology of hazard sources must be expanded to include emission/discharge data in order to adequately address environmental justice issues on who bears the burdens of environmental contamination.},

These factors were placed in an additive model to compute a summary score\textemdash the Social Vulnerability Index. Results. There are some distinct spatial patterns in the SoVI, with the most vulnerable counties clustered in metropolitan counties in the east, south Texas, and the Mississippi Delta region. Conclusion. Those factors that contribute to the overall score often are different for each county, underscoring the interactive nature of social vulnerability\textemdash some components increase vulnerability; others moderate the effects.},

How can we re-design the concept of Well-being and Public Health in relation to the living places of the future? Methods: According to the previous statements and scenario, this paper aims to integrate the building hygiene and well-being, focusing the possible responses, both existing and for the new buildings, taking home a strong message from this ``period'' of physical distancing. Results: The Well-being and Public Health recommendations for a healthy, safe, and sustainable housing are framed into the following key points: 1. Visible and accessible green elements and spaces; 2. Flexibility, adaptability, sharing, and crowding of living spaces, and compliant functions located into the buildings; 3. Re-appropriation of the basic principles and archetypes of sustainable architecture, thermal comfort and Indoor Air Quality (IAQ); 4. Water consumption and Wastewater Management; 5. Urban Solid Waste Management; 6. Housing automation and electromagnetic fields; 7. Indoor building and finishing materials. Conclusions: The Well-being and Public Health recommendations for a healthy, safe and sustainable housing may provide a useful basis for Designers, Policy Makers (fostering tax incentives for building renewal), Public Health experts and Local Health Agencies, in promoting actions and policies aimed to transform living places in healthier and Salutogenic spaces.},

Several efforts have been made to better understand these three arboviruses. Spatial analysis plays an important role in the knowledge of disease dynamics. The knowledge of the patterns of spatial diffusion of these three arboviruses during an epidemic can contribute to the planning of surveillance actions and control of these diseases. This study aimed to identify the spatial diffusion processes of these viruses in the context of the triple epidemic in 2015\textendash 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Two study designs were used: cross-sectional and ecological. Sequential Kernel maps, nearest-neighbour ratios calculated cumulatively over time, Moran global autocorrelation correlograms, and local autocorrelation changes over time were used to identify spatial diffusion patterns. The results suggested an expansion diffusion pattern for the three arboviruses during 2015\textendash 2016 in Rio de Janeiro. These findings can be considered for more effective control measures and for new studies on the dynamics of these three arboviruses.},

For such large databases it is logical to attempt to cleanse the data in an automated way. This has led to the development of commercial tools for automatic cleansing. However, offering data cleansing as a service has been a challenge because of the need to customize the tool for different datasets. This is because current commercial systems lack the ability to incorporate the unique exceptions of different data sources. This makes the migration of underlying data cleansing algorithms from one dataset to another difficult. In this paper we specifically look at the address standardization task. We use Ripple Down Rules (RDR) framework to lower the manual effort required in rewriting the rules from one source to another. The RDR framework allows us to incrementally patch the existing rules or add exceptions without breaking other rules. We compare the RDR approach with a conditional random field (CRF) address standardization system and an existing commercially available data cleansing tool. We demonstrate that RDR is an effective knowledge acquisition method and that its adoption for data cleansing can allow data cleansing to be offered as a service.},

But when detailing the many things that the poor have not, we often overlook the most critical\textemdash their health. The poor die sooner. Blacks die sooner. And poor urban blacks die sooner than almost all other Americans. In nearly four decades as a doctor at hospitals serving some of the poorest communities in Chicago, David A. Ansell, MD,~ has witnessed firsthand the lives behind these devastating statistics. In The Death Gap, he gives a grim survey of these realities, drawn from observations and stories of his patients.While the contrasts and disparities among Chicago's communities are particularly stark, the death gap is truly a nationwide epidemic\textemdash as Ansell shows, there is a thirty-five-year difference in life expectancy between the healthiest and wealthiest and the poorest and sickest American neighborhoods. If you are poor, where you live in America can dictate when you die. It doesn't need to be this way; such divisions are not inevitable. Ansell calls out the social and cultural arguments that have been raised as ways of explaining or excusing these gaps, and he lays bare the structural violence\textemdash the racism, economic exploitation, and discrimination\textemdash that is really to blame. Inequality is a disease, Ansell argues, and we need to treat and eradicate it as we would any major illness. To do so, he outlines a vision that will provide the foundation for a healthier nation\textemdash for all.Inequality is all around us, and often the distance between high and low life expectancy can be a matter of just a few blocks. But geography need not be destiny, urges ~Ansell. In The Death Gap he shows us how we can face this national health crisis head-on and take action against the circumstances that rob people of their dignity and their lives.},

  abstract = {Seemingly overnight, companies like Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, WeWork, Taskrabbit, Shyp, and many others have transformed transportation, accommodations, personal services, and other sectors. The evolving regulatory response to this ``sharing economy'' presents an intriguing puzzle.  Where telephone, broadband, early Internet companies, and similar previous technologies were shaped by battles with federal regulators, the fate of sharing enterprises is playing out in front of taxi and limousine commissions, zoning boards, and city councils.The reason for this atypical dynamic, this Article argues, is that \textemdash{} unlike prior technological disruptions \textemdash{} the sharing economy is fundamentally an urban phenomenon.  The platforms that enable sharing leverage or confront conditions of density, proximity, specialization, and even anonymity that mark city life.  And many sharing companies flourish through a kind of regulatory arbitrage that finds value in frictions and barriers generated by urban regulatory regimes.A fascinating experimentalist dialectic is emerging from the resulting decentralized regulatory landscape.  Local economic, political, legal, and social conditions are generating regulatory responses that range from full embrace to open hostility.  And sharing enterprises are responding by adjusting their business models and reconciling in various ways to these regulatory constraints. These compromises are generating creative solutions to balancing innovation and public welfare.The interaction between urban governance and the sharing economy, however, flows both ways.  Local governments are being pushed to be more transparent about their policy interests, creating spillover effects in regulatory regimes beyond the sharing economy. And the sharing economy is transforming cities themselves.  The shift from ownership to access is altering development and mobility patterns as traditional links between transportation, housing, and labor markets and the shape of metropolitan space morph.By framing the sharing economy as an urban phenomenon, this Article sheds important new light on a rapidly emerging scholarly discourse.  To date, scholars have failed to recognize the sharing economy's deep reliance on the urban fabric and its potential to mold that fabric. Understanding this relationship will also lead to better calibrated regulatory responses that reflect the sharing economy's holistic impact on cities. Equally important, it will firmly ground our understanding of the sharing economy in its urban birthplace as it matures.},

The active living movement initially targeted mostly middle-class, suburban communities. In this article, I argue that planning for active living must especially address low-income, Black, and Latino communities, where obesity and related health risks are greatest and resources least available. First I review the problem of obesity and related health conditions among low-income, Black, and Latino populations in the U.S., and identify the role of insufficient physical activity in this problem. I then examine physical environment and other factors that shape opportunities for physical activity in low-income communities and communities of color. Finally, I identify strategies that may help to promote active living in urban settings to better serve these communities.},

  abstract = {Findings are presented from a study of land use, parking, mode choice, and housing and jobs development in downtown Berkeley, California, a medium-sized city with 4 decades of experience with parking management and transit-oriented development. The multiple roles that parking management, including reduced parking requirements and parking pricing, can play in a downtown area are explored, as is the performance of transit-oriented development in smaller cities. Originally developed as a streetcar suburb, Berkeley has long supported high-quality transit, restricted parking, and walking and biking facilities. These practices have resulted in transit, walk, and bike usage far higher than U.S. averages. Nevertheless, in downtown Berkeley, traffic is heavy, parking is full, and concerns about infill development persist. Merchants are also concerned that parking constraints may limit economic development. Surveys of downtown shoppers, workers, and residents show that relatively few drive downtown. Workers and downtown residents make up a large share of downtown commercial enterprises' customers. Residents have intentionally chosen to live in a transit- and pedestrian-friendly area and own and use cars far less often than average. Parking shortages are caused in large part by overtime parking, facilitated by broken meters and by meter feeding by employees. Overall, transit-oriented development has been successful in reducing auto ownership and use, but it is accompanied by tight parking and a certain amount of congestion. Parking enforcement and better use of off-street spaces would relieve the former problem.},

Many promising initiatives have emerged over the years. Despite these initiatives, there is still a lack of understanding about an appropriate definition of smart transport system. As such, it is challenging to identify the appropriate indicators of `smartness'. This paper proposes a comprehensive and practical framework to benchmark cities according to the smartness in their transportation systems. The proposed methodology was illustrated using a set of data collected from 26 cities across the world through web search and contacting relevant transport authorities and agencies. Results showed that London, Seattle and Sydney were among the world's top smart transport cities. In particular, Seattle and Paris ranked high in smart private transport services while London and Singapore scored high on public transport services. London also appeared to be the smartest in terms of emergency transport services. The key value of the proposed innovative framework lies in a comparative analysis among cities, facilitating city-to-city learning.},

  abstract = {Background The field of risk assessment has focused on protecting the health of individual people or populations of wildlife from single risks, mostly from chemical exposure. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently began to address multiple risks to communities in the ``Framework for Cumulative Risk Assessment'' [EPA/630/P02/001F. Washington DC:Risk Assessment Forum, ]., Simultaneously, several reports concluded that some individuals and groups are more vulnerable to environmental risks than the general population. However, vulnerability has received little specific attention in the risk assessment literature. Objective Our objective is to examine the issue of vulnerability in cumulative risk assessment and present a conceptual framework rather than a comprehensive review of the literature. In this article we consider similarities between ecologic and human communities and the factors that make communities vulnerable to environmental risks. Discussion The literature provides substantial evidence on single environmental factors and simple conditions that increase vulnerability or reduce resilience for humans and ecologic systems. This observation is especially true for individual people and populations of wildlife. Little research directly addresses the topic of vulnerability in cumulative risk situations, especially at the community level. The community level of organization has not been adequately considered as an end point in either human or ecologic risk assessment. Furthermore, current information on human risk does not completely explain the level of response in cumulative risk conditions. Ecologic risk situations are similarly more complex and unpredictable for cases of cumulative risk. Conclusions Psychosocial conditions and responses are the principal missing element for humans. We propose a model for including psychologic and social factors as an integral component of cumulative risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Background Land-use regression (LUR) and dispersion models (DM) are commonly used for estimating individual air pollution exposure in population studies. Few comparisons have however been made of the performance of these methods. Objectives Within the European Study of Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects (ESCAPE) we explored the differences between LUR and DM estimates for NO2, PM10 and PM2.5. Methods The ESCAPE study developed LUR models for outdoor air pollution levels based on a harmonised monitoring campaign. In thirteen ESCAPE study areas we further applied dispersion models. We compared LUR and DM estimates at the residential addresses of participants in 13 cohorts for NO2; 7 for PM10 and 4 for PM2.5. Additionally, we compared the DM estimates with measured concentrations at the 20\textendash 40 ESCAPE monitoring sites in each area. Results The median Pearson R (range) correlation coefficients between LUR and DM estimates for the annual average concentrations of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5 were 0.75 (0.19\textendash 0.89), 0.39 (0.23\textendash 0.66) and 0.29 (0.22\textendash 0.81) for 112,971 (13 study areas), 69,591 (7) and 28,519 (4) addresses respectively. The median Pearson R correlation coefficients (range) between DM estimates and ESCAPE measurements were of 0.74 (0.09\textendash 0.86) for NO2; 0.58 (0.36\textendash 0.88) for PM10 and 0.58 (0.39\textendash 0.66) for PM2.5. Conclusions LUR and dispersion model estimates correlated on average well for NO2 but only moderately for PM10 and PM2.5, with large variability across areas. DM predicted a moderate to large proportion of the measured variation for NO2 but less for PM10 and PM2.5.},

This article surveys the evidence on the determinants of industry location in developing countries. It also employs micro data for India and Indonesia to illustrate recent spatial dynamics of manufacturing relocation within urban agglomerations. Both theory and empirical evidence suggest that agglomeration benefits, market access, and infrastructure endowments in large cities outweigh the costs of congestion, higher wages, and land prices. Despite this evidence, many countries have tried to encourage industrial firms to locate in secondary cities or other lagging areas. Cross-country evidence suggests that fiscal incentives to do so rarely succeed. They appear to influence business location decisions among comparable locations, but the result may be a negative-sum game between regions and inefficiently low tax rates, which prevent public goods from being funded at sufficiently high levels. Relocation tends to be within and between agglomerations rather than from large cities to smaller cities or lagging regions. Rather than provide subsidies and tax breaks, policymakers should focus on streamlining laws and regulations to make the business environment more attractive.},

For generic non-site-specific assessments (e.g. for the requirements of most European directives on dangerous chemicals) risk is characterised just on the basis of the ratio between an effect indicator and an exposure indicator. However, when the actual risk for a specific ecosystem is desired, the concept of ecological vulnerability may be more appropriate. This calls for a change in thinking, from sensitivity at the organism level to vulnerability at higher organization levels, and thus forms the link from laboratory toxicology to field effects at population, community or ecosystem level. To do so, biological and ecological characteristics of the ecosystems under concern are needed to estimate the ecological vulnerability. In this review we describe different vulnerability analysis methods developed for populations (of a single species), communities (consisting of different populations of species) and ecosystems (community and habitat combined). We also give some examples of methods developed for socio-ecological systems. Aspects that all methods share are the use of expert judgment, the input of stakeholders, ranking and mapping of the results, and the qualitative nature of the results. A new general framework is presented to guide future ecological vulnerability analysis. This framework can be used as part of ecological risk assessment, but also in risk management. We conclude that the further quantification of ecological vulnerability is a valuable contribution to vulnerability assessment.},

At the crux of this debate is lifecycle cost: the annualized initial vehicle cost, plus annual operating and maintenance costs, plus battery replacement costs. To address this issue of cost, we have developed a detailed model of the performance, energy use, manufacturing cost, retail cost, and lifecycle cost of electric vehicles and comparable gasoline internal-combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This effort is an improvement over most previous studies of electric vehicle costs because instead of assuming important parameter values for such variables as vehicle efficiency and battery cost, we model these values in detail. We find that in order for electric vehicles to be cost-competitive with gasoline ICEVs, batteries must have a lower manufacturing cost, and a longer life, than the best lithium-ion and nickel\textendash metal hydride batteries we modeled. We believe that it is most important to reduce the battery manufacturing cost to \$100/kWh or less, attain a cycle life of 1200 or more and a calendar life of 12 years or more, and aim for a specific energy of around 100 Wh/kg.},

This study explores the services, supports, and accommodations that people with disabilities use to find and keep competitive employment; how they obtain needed supports; and the extent to which they pay out of pocket for work-related supports. We conducted an exploratory study using in-depth interviews with 15 workers with disabilities who in 2013 earned at least 250\% of the poverty level, or about US\$28,000 a year for a single person. Most respondents needed some supports or accommodations to sustain their employment, but on the whole, these supports were neither costly nor resource intensive for employers to provide. The most frequently used supports were assistive technology (AT), including wheelchairs, communication devices such as video relay phones, and visual aids to enhance individuals' access to information. Respondents also used staff supports and modified work schedules. Out-of-pocket costs for services and supports used on and off the job ranged from US\$0 to US\$14,800 per year for personal care assistants, medical goods and services, coinsurance payments, AT, and service animals. Individual needs, the nature of the job, and the extent to which health insurance or other sources covered the costs for work-related services and supports all factored into the challenges these workers with disabilities encountered and the solutions they devised to find and keep jobs that pay at least a moderate salary.},

Such research often suffers from limitations in race/ethnicity data quality. We examined the quality of race/ethnicity data in a large, diverse, integrated health system that repeatedly collects these data on utilization of services. We tested the accuracy of Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding for imputation of race/ethnicity data. Administrative race/ethnicity data were accurate as judged by comparison with self-report in adults. The Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding method produced imputation results far better than chance assignment for the four most common race/ethnicity groups in the health system: Whites, Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians. These results support renewed efforts to conduct studies of racial and ethnic disparities in large health systems.},

  abstract = {Since the late 19th century, Florida's promoters and civic leaders have constructed the state as a tourist destination. The result was a Florida Dream that visitors and migrants could interpret according to their own expectations: as an hedonist escape from the routine of work and family; as a warm refuge from northern winters; as a rapidly expanding pool of economic opportunity. Florida's immense popularity as a tourist destination and migrant haven was then built on that Dream, as well as on abundant and escapist promotion, on transportation technology, on the development of its real estate industry and of its tourist accommodations, on rising disposable incomes since the 1940s. Florida's population grew rapidly, in great part because of its tourism. This thesis explains and analyzes the phenomenon of seasonal, long-term winter travel to Florida, travelers that South Floridians have called  snowbirds. It demonstrates what pushed and pulled snowbirds to Florida, analyzes their journey south, their settlement patterns and housing choices, their tendency to congregate together, the forms of their sociability. It mostly defines snowbirds as migrants who, down South, build communities of kindred spirits. In the fragmented built landscape of 20th-century Florida, the congregation of snowbirds produced unique forms of socialization and, we argue, of community. These unique settlements have uniquely influenced Floridians' debates about their own community-building issues, while playing a part in Northerners' views about Florida, the South, the North, the United States and Canada. Snowbirds, from their standpoint on Florida and North America, were agents in the definition of peculiar yet deeply modern, North American forms of sociability and community, as well as agents in the ongoing collective conversation creating a (late) modern folklore of leisure, geography, mobility, topophilia and identity.},

Previous literature reviews have focused on either passengers' or transit agencies' perspectives on service reliability. However, none of the earlier reviews have simultaneously addressed these differing perspectives on service reliability in an integrated manner. In response to this gap in the literature, this paper first reviews previous work on passengers' perspectives of transit service reliability and their response to service adjustments made by different agencies. Second, it analyzes transit agencies' plans and reports regarding their reliability goals and used strategies in order to improve service reliability, while looking at the impacts of these strategies on service. Reviewing these two parts together provides a needed contribution to the literature from a practical viewpoint since it allows for the identification of gaps in the public transit planning and operations field in the area of reliability and provides transit planners and decision makers with effective and valuable policy-relevant information.},

In the simulation, each car driver has an activity schedule throughout the day, moving on the network for various purposes toward different locations. The model includes activities and required trips of all the drivers in a city based on travel survey data. Situational characteristics, such as a combination of the driver's behavior, traffic, walking distance to the destination, and the availability of parking places, determine the parking search behavior of agents. Various categories of drivers' parking search behavior reflect the outcome of experiments with observations of drivers under different conditions. The interaction with other cars is modeled as an application of traffic rules. The translation of the physical vehicle movements into a computer program is done by means of traffic cellular automata. We apply the model to the city of Leuven, in Belgium, and calculate various parameters for different scenarios. These parameters include the parking occupancies, the parking search times, the spatial distributions of parking durations, the distances between parking places and destinations, the bottlenecks, and overcapacities of parking. The stability of the model's outcome was assessed by running the same baseline scenario 15 times.},

Although the sharing economy is profitable, little is known about its use among the unemployed or those struggling financially. This paper describes the results of a participatory-design based workshop to investigate the perception and feasibility of finding temporary employment and sharing spare resources using sharing-economy applications. Specifically, this study included 20 individuals seeking employment in a U.S. city suffering economic decline.

  abstract = {The digital-sharing economy presents opportunities for individuals to find temporary employment, generate extra income, increase reciprocity, enhance social interaction, and access resources not otherwise attainable. Although the sharing economy is profitable, little is known about its use among the unemployed or those struggling financially. This paper describes the results of a participatory-design based workshop to investigate the perception and feasibility of finding temporary employment and sharing spare resources using sharing-economy applications. Specifically, this study included 20 individuals seeking employment in a U.S. city suffering economic decline. We identify success factors of the digital-sharing economy to these populations, identify shortcomings and propose mitigation strategies based on prior research related to trust, social capital and theories of collective efficacy.

  abstract = {Some surveys indicate that providing bicycle lanes and paths may encourage more people to commute by bicycle. The presence of a striped lane or separated path can increase a cyclist's perception of safety. With growing concerns over traffic congestion and vehicle pollution, public policy makers are increasingly promoting bicycling as an alternative for commuting and other utilitarian trip purposes. State and local spending on bicycle facilities has increased significantly over the past decade. Previous studies have linked higher levels of bicycle commuting to various demographic and geographic variables. At least one analysis showed that cities with higher levels of bicycle infrastructure (lanes and paths) witnessed higher levels of bicycle commuting. Research was conducted that affirms that finding by analyzing data from 43 large cities across the United States. This cross-sectional analysis improves on previous research by including a larger sample of cities, not including predominantly college towns, and using consistent data from the Bureau of the Census 2000 Supplemental Survey. Although the analysis has limitations, it does support the assertion that new bicycle lanes in large cities will be used by commuters.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this research is to identify correlations with bike station ridership for Pronto, a bike share program in Seattle. The daily number of trips and station-level trips from October 13th, 2014 to October 12th, 2015 was obtained from Pronto. Data for independent variables were from various sources. Polynomial regression models with cubic and quadratic terms are used to evaluate the relationship between weather and temporal factors on daily system-wide ridership and the effects on different types of users. Multiple linear regression models are used to investigate the effects of built environment variables on station-level ridership in 0.25-mile, 0.5-mile, and 0.75-mile scales. The models have high goodness of fit and identify a number of variables having statistically significant correlations with ridership. Temperature and wind speed are not linearly associated with daily ridership. Rain, weekends, and holidays decrease daily ridership. Different effects of weather and temporal factors on annual members and short-term pass holders are also captured in this research. Annual members, who are less affected by rainfalls than short-term pass holders, are more likely to use Pronto on weekdays while short-term pass holders tend to use Pronto on weekends and holidays. In addition, the station-level ridership is negatively associated with job density, proximity to parks, and proximity to waterfront in all three buffers. The findings will help planners and managers to predict daily ridership, optimize bike locations, and improve bike rebalance efficiency.},

The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to address the same problems is increasing rapidly. Operational models e.g. OSPM, AERMOD, ADMS-Urban have undergone many comprehensive formal evaluations as to their ``fitness for purpose'' while CFD models do not have such an evaluation record in the urban air quality context. This paper looks at the application of both approaches to common problems. In particular, pollutant dispersion from point and line sources in the simplest neutral atmospheric boundary layer and line sources placed within different regular building geometries is studied with the CFD code FLUENT and the atmospheric dispersion model ADMS-Urban. Both the effect of street canyons of different aspect ratios and various obstacle array configurations consisting of cubical buildings are investigated. The standard k \textendash{} {$\epsilon$} turbulence model and the advection\textendash diffusion (AD) method (in contrast to the Lagrangian particle tracking method) are used for the CFD simulations. Results from the two approaches are compared. Overall CFD simulations with the appropriate choice of coefficients produce similar concentration fields to those predicted by the integral approach. However, some quantitative differences are observed. These differences can be explained by investigating the role of the Schmidt number in the CFD simulations. A further interpretation of the differences between the two approaches is given by quantifying the exchange velocities linked to the mass fluxes between the in-canopy and above-canopy layers.},

The results showed that the epidemic spread with significant spatial-temporal autocorrelation. In order to describe the spatial-temporal autocorrelation of H7N9, an improved model was developed by introducing a spatial-temporal factor in this paper. Logistic regression analyses were utilized to investigate the risk factors associated with their distribution, and nine risk factors were significantly associated with the occurrence of A(H7N9) human infections: the spatial-temporal factor {$\varphi$} (OR = 2546669.382, p {$<$} 0.001), migration route (OR = 0.993, p {$<$} 0.01), river (OR = 0.861, p {$<$} 0.001), lake(OR = 0.992, p {$<$} 0.001), road (OR = 0.906, p {$<$} 0.001), railway (OR = 0.980, p {$<$} 0.001), temperature (OR = 1.170, p {$<$} 0.01), precipitation (OR = 0.615, p {$<$} 0.001) and relative humidity (OR = 1.337, p {$<$} 0.001). The improved model obtained a better prediction performance and a higher fitting accuracy than the traditional model: in the improved model 90.1\% (91/101) of the cases during February 2014 occurred in the high risk areas (the predictive risk {$>$} 0.70) of the predictive risk map, whereas 44.6\% (45/101) of which overlaid on the high risk areas (the predictive risk {$>$} 0.70) for the traditional model, and the fitting accuracy of the improved model was 91.6\% which was superior to the traditional model (86.1\%). The predictive risk map generated based on the improved model revealed that the east and southeast of China were the high risk areas of A(H7N9) human infections in February 2014. These results provided baseline data for the control and prevention of future human infections.},

  abstract = {Problem This research examines older drivers and how they rationalize and cope with their own changing psychological and physical functioning vis-\`a-vis self-regulation and driving. Method A national survey was mailed to a sample of drivers over the age of 50. An overall response rate of 53.11\% was achieved, with 3,824 valid responses returned. This paper discusses the qualitative findings of the open-ended questions in this survey. Results A rich, multidimensional description of self-regulation emerged from the data. Driving self-regulation was not simply a checklist of behaviors performed but a combination of attitudes and behaviors, including important social and psychological processes and automobile attributes. Household composition played an important role in determining what one's options were for getting around and how serious they were in enforcing self-regulation behaviors. Discussion \&amp; Summary As a society, we must realize the importance of driving in maintaining independence, feelings of self-worth, and being connected to life and society. This research presents the qualitative findings of a nationwide survey of drivers over the age of 50. The results revealed that older drivers define self-regulation as much more than the changes in behaviors due to declining health and ability. The older adults in our research strongly emphasized the psychological processes surrounding independence, self-worth, remaining connected to life and society, and what role the automobile plays. Household composition impacted decisions related to self-regulation. For instance, those from a two-person household were more willing to let their partner drive or share in the driving, while those who lived alone were less likely to self-regulate their driving. Impact on Industry Education programs targeting older adults need to be expanded to include not only the behavioral components of self-regulation, but also the psychological factors that play an equally meaningful role. Legislators devising policy programs need to reconsider what are viable transportation options for the older adult.},

  abstract = {The development of mass transit systems can provide environmental and socio-economic benefits to cities that promote transit-oriented development (TOD). The private sector, municipal government, and community often play competing roles in land-use decision-making processes that may include, or exclude, TOD. In the case of Ogden, Utah, the role of the city as a growth machine, or economic engine, in which private investment and gain is privileged over the communal, is differentiated from community based input in the efforts to shape that place. A close look at the city's transit proposals reveals that there is a need for balance within the triad of privatism, government, and community. As the case study presented here demonstrates, the role and importance of community activism in selecting appropriate transit and defining place should not be underestimated nor overlooked. Identification of the sources of tension between government, business, and community actors and within the public (government) sector (e.g., the mayor's office versus city council) could be instructive to communities both within the United States and abroad that may face similar land-use conflicts and transit challenges. Issues of zoning and route selection are also shown to be key variables in TOD planning.},

By examining how organizational characteristics moderate establishments' responses to a prominent environmental information disclosure program, we provide among the first empirical evidence characterizing heterogeneous responses by those mandated to disclose information. We find particularly rapid improvement among establishments located close to their headquarters and among establishments with proximate siblings, especially when the proximate siblings are in the same industry. Large establishments improve more slowly than small establishments in sparse regions, but both groups perform similarly in dense regions, suggesting that density mitigates the power of large establishments to resist institutional pressures. Finally, establishments owned by private firms outperform those owned by public firms. We highlight implications for institutional theory, managers, and policymakers.

After demonstrating that environmental inequality outcomes vary widely across metropolitan areas and that each group in the analysis experiences a high pollution disadvantage in multiple metropolitan areas and a medium pollution disadvantage in many metropolitan areas, the authors test three hypotheses that make predictions about the role that residential segregation and racial income inequality play in producing environmental inequality. Using logistic regression models to test these hypotheses, the authors find that residential segregation and racial income inequality are relatively poor predictors of environmental inequality outcomes, that residential segregation can increase and decrease racial/ethnic group proximity to environmental hazards, and that the roles income inequality and residential segregation play in producing environmental inequality vary from one racial/ethnic group to another.},

However, a careful regression analysis of measures of both sprawl and urban decline shows no statistically significant relation between these two conditions. The basic nature of the American urban development process would cause core-area poverty concentrations even if sprawl were replaced by more compact growth forms. But sprawl does aggravate growth-related problems. Those problems could be attacked through either alternative overall growth strategies\textemdash such as high-density, tightly bounded growth\textemdash or specific anti-sprawl tactics, such as regional tax-base sharing and regional coordination of land uses. But no feasible policies are likely either to alleviate traffic congestion much or cause most American regions to abandon sprawl.},

  abstract = {In many developing countries, public transit plays an important role in daily life. However, few existing methods have considered the influence of public transit in their models. In this work, we present a dual-perspective view of the epidemic spreading process of the individual that involves both contamination in places (such as work places and homes) and public transit (such as buses and trains). In more detail, we consider a group of individuals who travel to some places using public transit, and introduce public transit into the epidemic spreading process. A novel modeling framework is proposed considering place-based infections and the public-transit-based infections. In the urban scenario, we investigate the public transit trip contribution rate (PTTCR) in the epidemic spreading process of the individual, and assess the impact of the public transit trip contribution rate by evaluating the volume of infectious people. Scenarios for strategies such as public transit and school closure were tested and analyzed. Our simulation results suggest that individuals with a high public transit trip contribution rate will increase the volume of infectious people when an infectious disease outbreak occurs by affecting the social network through the public transit trip contribution rate.},

Some argue that if planners can help guide local food systems with models of food accessibility in mind, they can help fill the gap and provide the opportunity for more urban residents to make proper food choices. This paper seeks to quantify and map accessibility of the food system in Toledo, Ohio, using geographic information science to measure the accessibility of each block group to retailers selling a selection of fresh foods to determine whether spatial accessibility to food outlets carrying nutritious and healthy choices is a concern in Toledo. The results indicate that one's race, level of income, or other demographic characteristics cannot predict the likelihood of residing in an area of lower than average access. Thus, socioeconomic factors are not good predictors for where accessibility is hindered in Toledo, but several neighborhoods do have both low-income populations and low accessibility rates. This information can guide the discussion of local food systems planning and identify neighborhoods that could have significant numbers of residents facing food accessibility challenges.},

This research builds on existing comparison techniques that focus on gridded street systems and expands the techniques to include all types of street networks, transit schedules, and passenger demand levels. The generic techniques are presented and a case study is given for Atlanta, Georgia, to determine where demand-responsive feeder systems could be implemented to improve customer satisfaction and reduce operating costs.},

  abstract = {Green economy has become one of the most fashionable terms in global environmental public policy discussions and forums. Despite this popularity, and its being selected as one of the organizing themes of the United Nations Rio+20 Conference in Brazil, June 2012, its prospects as an effective mobilization tool for global environmental sustainability scholarship and practice remain unclear. A major reason for this is that much like its precursor concepts such as environmental sustainability and sustainable development, green economy is a woolly concept, which lends itself to many interpretations. Hence, rather than resolve long-standing controversies, green economy merely reinvigorates existing debates over the visions, actors and policies best suited to secure a more sustainable future for all. In this review article, we aim to fill an important gap in scholarship by suggesting various ways in which green economy may be organized and synthesized as a concept, and especially in terms of its relationship with the idea of social and environmental justice. Accordingly, we offer a systemization of possible interpretations of green economy mapped onto a synthesis of existing typologies of environmental justice. This classification provides the context for future analysis of which, and how, various notions of green economy link with various conceptions of justice.},

In short, we have become the dominant animal. Why, then, are we creating a world that threatens our own species? What can we do to change the current trajectory toward more climate change, increased famine, and epidemic disease?~Renowned Stanford scientists Paul R. Ehrlich and Anne H. Ehrlich believe that intelligently addressing those questions depends on a clear understanding of how we evolved and how and why we're changing the planet in ways that darken our descendants' future. The Dominant Animal arms readers with that knowledge, tracing the interplay between environmental change and genetic and cultural evolution since the dawn of humanity. In lucid and engaging prose, they describe how Homo sapiens adapted to their surroundings, eventually developing the vibrant cultures, vast scientific knowledge, and technological wizardry we know today.~But the Ehrlichs also explore the flip side of this triumphant story of innovation and conquest. As we clear forests to raise crops and build cities, lace the continents with highways, and create chemicals never before seen in nature, we may be undermining our own supremacy. The threats of environmental damage are clear from the daily headlines, but the outcome is far from destined. Humanity can again adapt\textemdash if we learn from our evolutionary past.~Those lessons are crystallized in The Dominant Animal. Tackling the fundamental challenge of the human predicament, Paul and Anne Ehrlich offer a vivid and unique exploration of our origins, our evolution, and our future.},

  abstract = {Social equity is increasingly incorporated as a long-term objective into urban transportation plans. Researchers use accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.},

Data Source. Surname, geocoded residential address, and self-reported race/ethnicity from 1,973,362 enrollees of a national health plan. Study Design. We compare the accuracy of a Bayesian approach to combining surname and geocoded information to estimate race/ethnicity to two other indirect methods: a non-Bayesian method that combines surname and geocoded information and geocoded information alone. We assess accuracy with respect to estimating (1) individual race/ethnicity and (2) overall racial/ethnic prevalence in a population. Principal Findings. The Bayesian approach was 74 percent more efficient than geocoding alone in estimating individual race/ethnicity and 56 percent more efficient in estimating the prevalence of racial/ethnic groups, outperforming the non-Bayesian hybrid on both measures. The non-Bayesian hybrid was more efficient than geocoding alone in estimating individual race/ethnicity but less efficient with respect to prevalence (p{$<$}.05 for all differences). Conclusions. The Bayesian Surname and Geocoding (BSG) method presented here efficiently integrates administrative data, substantially improving upon what is possible with a single source or from other hybrid methods; it offers a powerful tool that can help health care organizations address disparities until self-reported race/ethnicity data are available.},

Automated methods to measure travel behaviors will improve research in this area. In this paper we present a supervised machine learning method for transportation mode prediction from GPS and accelerometer data. Methods: We collected a dataset of about 150 hours of GPS and accelerometer data from two research assistants following a protocol of prescribed trips consisting of five activities: bicycling, riding in a vehicle, walking, sitting, and standing. We extracted 49 features from 1-minute windows of this data. We compared the performance of several machine learning algorithms and chose a random forest algorithm to classify the transportation mode. We used a moving average output filter to smooth the output predictions over time. Results: The random forest algorithm achieved 89.8\% cross-validated accuracy on this dataset. Adding the moving average filter to smooth output predictions increased the cross-validated accuracy to 91.9\%. Conclusions: Machine learning methods are a viable approach for automating measurement of active travel, particularly for measuring travel activities that traditional accelerometer data processing methods misclassify, such as bicycling and vehicle travel.},

These three arguments revolve around market acceptance, environmental risk, and the lack of democratic and transparent process in biotech regulation and policy. This paper argues that producer interests were not displaced by, but rather articulated alongside and through consumer-driven discourses.

Unfortunately, most research on this contemporary urban phenomenon has focused on Northern Europe and the United States, not Australia. To redress this imbalance, this paper examines why intercity competition has intensified, outlining the main features of place promotion and marketing and then examining how the Kennett Coalition government place-marketed Melbourne and Victoria within the Asia-Pacific Rim region. It attempts to assess whether the place marketing campaign succeeded and highlights a number of limitations with this mode of urban analysis.},

To account for this lacuna, researchers must analyze how driverless cars could hinder or help social justice. In addition to thinking through these aspects, scholars must also pay attention to the extensive moral dimensions of automated vehicles, including how they will affect the public, nonhumans, future generations, and culturally significant artifacts. If planners and engineers undertake this task, then they will have to prioritize their efforts to avoid additional harm. The author shows how employing an approach called a ``complex moral assessment'' can help professionals implement these technologies into existing mobility systems in a just and moral fashion.},

While such measures can alleviate several harms that transit systems cause, they rest on an incomplete foundation due to their top-down nature.

  abstract = {The aim of this research project was to include motorcycles as an urban means of transport in the assessment of future mobility scenarios using the large scale, agent-based transport simulation software MATSim. To this end, we implemented a new meso-scopic traffic flow simulation algorithm. Using a simple test network, we demonstrated that the new algorithm allows to reproduce the typical condition of mixed traffic flow where motorcycles can maintain higher speeds than cars at high traffic densities, but still are affected in terms of speed and throughput capacity by congestion. The algorithm is designed for computational performance and hence allows to be used in large-scale simulations which was demonstrated by integrating it into the MATSim model of Singapore.  In case study A, the size of the motorcycle fleet in Singapore was expanded by 70\%. The simulation demonstrated that those new motorcycles would primarily be used for trips that, in the baseline simulation, are conducted by bus. The simulation results suggest that the average speed does not substantially drop due to the additional motorcycles. As people switching from bus to motorcycles benefit from higher travel speeds, the total time spent in traffic during one day reduces by 7.8\%.  In case study B, we tested the impact that a new shared eScooter service might have on the mobility patterns in Singapore. The simulation was set up in a way that assumes that, anybody holding a car or motorcycle driving license, can make use of shared eScooters, whose maximum speed is limited to 45km/h. Due to the restricted maximum speed and limited comfort for longer trip durations, the eScooters are primarily used for shorter trips, with the simulated average trip distance amounting to 7.1km. The simulation results show that 25\% of the latent demand for such a service is restricted to Singapore's extended city centre, which only covers about 5\% of the island's surface area.},

  abstract = {In 2009, European Union (EU) member states forged a long-awaited compromise on the recast buildings directive, agreeing that all new buildings would have to comply with high energy-performance standards by the end of 2020. The recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, which was finally announced in May 2010, requires the public sector to take the lead by owning buildings with ``nearly zero'' energy consumption standards by the end of 2018, which is two years in advance of the private sector. The objective of this chapter is to discuss both the range of potential consequences to European cities resulting from widespread implementation of zero energy buildings (ZEBs) and the relevant environmental technologies in accordance with the national goals set by the EU Member States. As EU member states are moving ahead with their targets and strategies for ZEBs, this chapter presents the most possible scenarios for the implementation of the EU recast buildings directive regarding ZEBs by 2020. A detailed review regarding the existing EU member states' definitions and policies on low energy buildings and ZEBs, and the current status of RES technologies for ZEBs is also presented. Finally, some first thoughts are provided regarding the minimisation of energy consumption in the building sector and the green city goal, as energy is considered to be one of the most important chapters when evaluating a green community. The next step for the integration of green buildings would be the adoption of principles resulting from ZEB analyses and descriptions in existing green building models.},

At the same time, the rationale for cultural input to area and neighbourhood regeneration has been extended to include quality of life, as well as economic outcomes. The evidence of how far flagship and major cultural projects contribute to a range of regeneration objectives is, however, limited. Measuring the social, economic and environmental impacts attributed to the cultural element in area regeneration is problematic and the 'evidence' is seldom robust.

The policy allows police officers to stop, question, and frisk individuals who are suspected of committing, having committed or about to commit a crime. Advocates of this policy contend that its purpose is to protect civilians and police officers, as it enables officers to detain persons that they believe are in possession of unlawfully concealed weapons. Critics maintain that the practice violates civil rights and leads to racial profiling. Limited research has moved beyond these types of descriptive examinations of the Stop and Frisk data. Our project employs data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the New York Civil Liberties Union on 2011 NYPD stops and frisks. In moving beyond the descriptive stage, this research utilizes a spatially centered analytical approach to measure and identify geographic clusters of high Stop and Frisk rates across New York City police precincts and subsequent spatial regression to link variations in those rates to community level characteristics. Results indicate both significant spatial clusters of high rates of race-specific stops and a series of statistically significant relationships of those variations to similar variations in explanatory variables.},

In 2015, the United States' Department of Transportation announced the official target of the federal government transportation safety policy was zero deaths. In 2017, we assessed the dissemination of Vision Zero in the United States.Methods We conducted a web-based survey in 2017 among road safety professionals. Email invitations were sent using relevant membership directories and conference lists.ResultsWe surveyed 192 road safety professionals, including planning/engineering (57.8\%), public health (16.7\%), and law enforcement/emergency medical services (EMS) (8.9\%). Awareness of Vision Zero was higher among planning/engineering fields (97.3\%) compared to law enforcement/EMS (76.5\%) and public health (75.0\%). Awareness was similar by number of years working in the field. Awareness was higher in the South (95.9\%) and Northeast (95.0\%) regions, followed by the West (90.8\%) and Midwest (85.2\%) Census regions. Among those that heard of Vision Zero (n = 174), 41.8\% worked at a municipality with a Vision Zero campaign, while 41.2\% did not. Among those working at a municipality with a Vision Zero campaign (n = 71), about half participated in the campaign (54.9\%) while the other half did not (45.1\%).ConclusionsWith widespread dissemination of the Vision Zero strategy to road safety professionals, next steps include evaluating how Vision Zero is being adopted, implemented, and maintained in communities, as well as the awareness and acceptability by community members, and to identify the most promising policies and practices.},

  abstract = {The potential to moderate travel demand through changes in the built environment is the subject of more than 50 recent empirical studies. The majority of recent studies are summarized. Elasticities of travel demand with respect to density, diversity, design, and regional accessibility are then derived from selected studies. These elasticity values may be useful in travel forecasting and sketch planning and have already been incorporated into one sketch planning tool, the Environmental Protection Agency's Smart Growth Index model. In weighing the evidence, what can be said, with a degree of certainty, about the effects of built environments on key transportation "outcome" variables: trip frequency, trip length, mode choice, and composite measures of travel demand, vehicle miles traveled (VMT) and vehicle hours traveled (VHT)? Trip frequencies have attracted considerable academic interest of late. They appear to be primarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics of travelers and secondarily a function of the built environment. Trip lengths have received relatively little attention, which may account for the various degrees of importance attributed to the built environment in recent studies. Trip lengths are primarily a function of the built environment and secondarily a function of socioeconomic characteristics. Mode choices have received the most intensive study over the decades. Mode choices depend on both the built environment and socioeconomics (although they probably depend more on the latter). Studies of overall VMT or VHT find the built environment to be much more significant, a product of the differential trip lengths that factor into calculations of VMT and VHT.},

  abstract = {In an effort to reduce circling and cruising in cities' central business districts (CBDs), a number of cities have begun implementing pricing programs that modify parking rates based on observed occupancy levels. We improve on this pricing mechanism by developing a forward-looking policy instrument. The instrument employs a two-stage panel data regression and optimization model that influences demand for parking spaces by changing parking rates via computed price elasticities of parking demand measures. Coefficient estimates that include the elasticity measures from the panel data regression are used to fit a linear prediction model that is the primary input to the optimization model. An application of the approach is presented using SFpark, a federal government-funded demonstration program in San Francisco as a case study. We evaluate the effectiveness of the modified pricing mechanism by comparing actual occupancy and parking rate tuples with the optimized result to ascertain the potential improvement in SFpark's performance. Policy scenarios are subsequently explored by carrying out sensitivity analysis primarily through SFpark pricing rules. Relative to SFpark's figures, our model yielded approximately 16\% improvement in systems performance when measured by the number of blocks that deviate from the 60 to 80\% occupancy target. Our findings highlight the importance of moving towards a predictive regime that allows for proactively managing the parking program compared to a reactive approach based on observed parking occupancy.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been increasing attention on bicycle-sharing systems (BSS) as a viable and sustainable mode of transportation for short trips. However, due to the relatively recent adoption of BSS, there is very little research exploring how people consider these systems within existing transportation options. Given recent BSS growth around the world, there is substantial interest in identifying contributing factors that encourage individuals to use these systems. The current study contributes to this growing literature by examining BSS behavior at the trip level to analyze bicyclists' destination preferences. Specifically, we study the decision process involved in identifying destination locations after picking up a bicycle at a BSS station, using a random utility maximization approach in the form of a multinomial logit model (MNL). The quantitative frameworks developed have been estimated using 2013 data from the Chicago's Divvy system. In our modeling effort, we distinguish between BSS users with annual membership and short-term customers with daily passes. The developed model should allow bicycle-sharing system operators to plan services more effectively by examining the impact of travel distance, land use, built environment, and access to public transportation infrastructure on users' destination preferences. Using the estimated model, we generated utility profiles as a function of distance and various other attributes, allowing us to represent visually the trade-offs that individuals make in the decision process. To illustrate further the applicability of the proposed framework for planning purposes, destination station-choice probability prediction is undertaken.},

  abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine the effect of residential racial segregation on all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in New York City. A cross-sectional study of residents in New York City was conducted linking mortality records from 1988 through 1994, to the 1990 United States Census data stratified by zipcode. All-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates for non-Hispanic blacks and whites were estimated by zipcode. Zipcodes were aggregated according to the degree of residential segregation (predominantly ( {$\leq$} 75\%) white and black areas) and mortality rates were compared. Multiple regression analysis was used to associate population characteristics with mortality. In New York City, although overall mortality rates of blacks exceed whites, these rates varied substantially by locality according to the pattern of racial segregation. Whites living in the higher (mainly white) socioeconomic areas had lower mortality rates than whites living in predominantly black areas (1473.7 vs 1934.1 for males, and 909.9 vs 1414.7 for females for all-cause mortality). This was true for all age groups. By contrast, elderly blacks living in black areas, despite their less favorable socioeconomic status, had lower mortality rates for all-cause, total cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease, than did those living in white areas, even after adjusting for available socioeconomic variables. Racial segregation in residence is independently associated with mortality. Within racially segregated areas, members of the dominant group, for all age, among whites and elderly blacks, enjoy outcomes superior both to members of the minority racial group of their community, and to members of the same race residing in other areas, where they are in the minority, independent of socio-economic status.},

  abstract = {Waiting time in transit travel is often perceived negatively and high-amenity stops and stations are becoming increasingly popular as strategies for mitigating transit riders' aversion to waiting. However, beyond recent evidence that realtime transit arrival information reduces perceived waiting time, there is limited empirical evidence as to which other specific station and stop amenities can effectively influence user perceptions of waiting time. To address this knowledge gap, the authors conducted a passenger survey and video-recorded waiting passengers at different types of transit stops and stations to investigate differences between survey-reported waiting time and video-recorded actual waiting time. Results from the survey and video observations show that the reported wait time on average is about 1.21 times longer than the observed wait time. Regression analysis was employed to explain the variation in riders' reported waiting time as a function of their objectively observed waiting time, as well as station and stop amenities, weather, time of the day, personal demographics, and trip characteristics. Based on the regression results, most waits at stops with no amenities are perceived at least 1.3 times as long as they actually are. Basic amenities including benches and shelters significantly reduce perceived waiting times. Women waiting for more than 10min in perceived insecure surroundings report waits as dramatically longer than they really are, and longer than do men in the same situation. The authors recommend a focus on providing basic amenities at stations and stops as broadly as possible in transit systems, and a particular focus on stops on low-frequency routes and in less safe areas for security measures.},

A physician-anthropologist with more than fifteen years in the field, Farmer writes from the front lines of the war against these modern plagues and shows why, even more than those of history, they target the poor. This "peculiarly modern inequality" that permeates AIDS, TB, malaria, and typhoid in the modern world, and that feeds emerging (or re-emerging) infectious diseases such as Ebola and cholera, is laid bare in Farmer's harrowing memoir rife with stories about diseases and human suffering. Using field work and new scholarship to challenge the accepted methodologies of epidemiology and international health, Farmer points out that most current explanatory strategies, from "cost-effective treatment" to patient "noncompliance," inevitably lead to blaming the victims. In reality, larger forces, global as well as local, determine why some people are sick and others are shielded from risk. Yet this moving autobiography is far from a hopeless inventory of insoluble problems. Farmer writes of what can be done in the face of seemingly overwhelming odds, by physicians and medical students determined to treat those in need: whether in their home countries or through medical outreach programs like Doctors without Borders. Infections and Inequalities weds meticulous scholarship in medical anthropology with a passion for solutions\textemdash remedies for the plagues of the poor and the social illnesses that have sustained them.},

  abstract = {The future of disability in America will depend on how well the U.S. prepares for and manages the demographic, fiscal, and technological developments that will unfold during the next two to three decades. Building upon two prior studies from the Institute of Medicine (the 1991 Institute of Medicine's report Disability in America and the 1997 report Enabling America), The Future of Disability in America examines both progress and concerns about continuing barriers that limit the independence, productivity, and participation in community life of people with disabilities. This book offers a comprehensive look at a wide range of issues, including the prevalence of disability across the lifespan; disability trends the role of assistive technology; barriers posed by health care and other facilities with inaccessible buildings, equipment, and information formats; the needs of young people moving from pediatric to adult health care and of adults experiencing premature aging and secondary health problems; selected issues in health care financing (e.g., risk adjusting payments to health plans, coverage of assistive technology); and the organizing and financing of disability-related research. The Future of Disability in America is an assessment of both principles and scientific evidence for disability policies and services. This book's recommendations propose steps to eliminate barriers and strengthen the evidence base for future public and private actions to reduce the impact of disability on individuals, families, and society.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review two indirect methods, geocoding and surname analysis, for estimating race/ethnicity as a means for health plans to assess disparities in care. STUDY DESIGN: Review of published articles and unpublished data on the use of geocoding and surname analyses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Few published studies have evaluated use of geocoding to estimate racial and ethnic characteristics of a patient population or to assess disparities in health care. Three of four studies showed similar estimates of the proportion of blacks and one showed nearly identical estimates of racial disparities, regardless of whether indirect or more direct measures (e.g., death certificate or CMS data) were used. However, accuracy depended on racial segregation levels in the population and region assessed and geocoding was unreliable for identifying Hispanics and Asians/Pacific Islanders. Similarly, several studies suggest surname analyses produces reasonable estimates of whether an enrollee is Hispanic or Asian/Pacific Islander and can identify disparities in care. However, accuracy depends on the concentrations of Asians or Hispanics in areas assessed. It is less accurate for women and more acculturated and higher SES persons due intermarriage, name changes, and adoption. Surname analysis is not accurate for identifying African Americans. Recent unpublished analyses suggest plans can successfully use a combined geocoding/surname analyses approach to identify disparities in care in most regions. Refinements based on Bayesian methods may make geocoding/surname analyses appropriate for use in areas where the accuracy is currently poor, but validation of these preliminary results is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Geocoding and surname analysis show promise for estimating racial/ethnic health plan composition of enrollees when direct data on major racial and ethnic groups are lacking. These data can be used to assess disparities in care, pending availability of self-reported race/ethnicity data.},

Zoning's original purpose was to protect home-owners in residential areas from devaluation by industrial and apartment uses that had been made footloose by trucks and buses around 1910-20. Completion of the interstate highway system around 1970 made jobs and employees so mobile that suburbs adopted growth controls to stem the tide. If zoning is indeed a substitute for home-value insurance, it seems worthwhile to investigate the possibility of home-equity insurance to reduce the demand for exclusionary zoning.},

Several themes have begun to emerge from studies examining bikeshare. Convenience is the major motivator for bikeshare use. Financial savings has been found to motivate those on a low income and the distance one lives from a docking station is an important predictor for bikeshare membership. In a range of countries, it has been found that just under 50\% of bikeshare members use the system less than once a month. Men use bikeshare more than women, but the imbalance is not as dramatic as private bike riding (at least in low cycling countries). Commuting is the most common trip purpose for annual members. Users are less likely than private cyclists to wear helmets, but in countries with mandatory helmet legislation, usage levels have suffered. Bikeshare users appear less likely to be injured than private bike riders. Future directions include integration with e-bikes, GPS (global positioning system), dockless systems and improved public transport integration. Greater research is required to quantify the impacts of bikeshare, in terms of mode choice, emissions, congestion and health.},

This synthesis represents a critically needed evaluation of the current state of global bike share research, in order to better understand, and maximize the effectiveness of current and future programs. Several consistent themes have emerged within the growing body of research on bike share programs. Firstly, the importance bike share members place on convenience and value for money appears paramount in their motivation to sign up and use these programs. Secondly, and somewhat counter intuitively, scheme members are more likely to own and use private bicycles than nonmembers. Thirdly, users demonstrate a greater reluctance to wear helmets than private bicycle riders and helmets have acted as a deterrent in jurisdictions in which helmets are mandatory. Finally, and perhaps most importantly from a sustainable transport perspective, the majority of scheme users are substituting from sustainable modes of transport rather than the car.},

Since the classic Chicago School models, the urban form of the metropolis has been conceptualized as a divided space, where affluent suburbs surround a less-advantaged and denser urban core. More recently, the concept of a great inversion has been advanced to capture the return of more advantaged groups to the urban center and the outward shift of poverty and disadvantage to the suburbs. To gain insight into contemporary urban form, we undertake a descriptive mapping exercise of the residential locations of three major classes\textemdash the advantaged class of knowledge, professionals and creative workers, the declining blue collar working class, and the less advantaged service class of workers\textemdash across a dozen of America's largest metro areas and their core cities. We find a pattern of class division and urban form that we refer to as the ``patchwork metropolis,'' where class divides cut across city and suburb alike. These divides appear to be conditioned by the location of the advantaged class that occupies and clusters around the most functional and desirable areas of the metropolis\textemdash close to the urban core, around transit, near knowledge institutions, and along areas of natural amenities. The less-advantaged classes are shunted into the spaces leftover or in between\textemdash either traditionally disadvantaged areas of the inner city or the fringes of the suburban and exurban periphery.},

The model suggests that in judging environmental management, people apply their values for the natural environment through psychological processes involving beliefs, aesthetic experience, and trust. A key aim of the study was to explore relationships among these processes. Through a mail survey, 487 Australians judged the acceptability of forest landscape management in Southern Tasmania. Structural equation modeling with these data provided general support for the model, confirming that all of the psychological processes are significant in the formation of acceptability judgments. The most important factor was found to be beliefs about consequences for the natural environment. A new finding to emerge from exploration of the model is that aesthetic experience is informed by values, particularly use/intrinsic values for nature, and in turn influences acceptability judgments mainly by influencing beliefs about consequences for the natural environment.},

Viewed independently, none of the themes can accurately describe the essence, character, or function of a city.    With respect to population, different countries have different definitions of urban.  (U.S. = 2,500 people; Denmark = 200 people; Greece = 10,000 people).  Big cities, however, are  are often thought of as being able to support specialized amenities including professional sports, opera and fine restaurants.   Big city economies are often thought to be functionally permanent (not a fully occupied football stadium) and functionally diverse (not strictly a mining town).  Cities are typically  incorporated and thus have an interacting and cooperating political structure that has the power to tax and provide services.  Typically large cities often provide residents more  cultural resources than most rural or suburban or exurban settings.  Cities typically have identifiable landscapes that include a variety of architecture/built structures--civilization is writ large on the landscape.    Early prerequisites for the original urban hearths included a long growing season and dependable water supply, an assemblage of domesticated crops and animals which could provide a dependable, balanced, and storable food supply, an accessible location with some form of land and/or water transportation; a system of writing; and plentiful building materials.     history of urbanization and patterns of urban growth  The urban banana of urbanization up until 1500 (the ocean epoch) .  the four centuries following 1500 the pattern of urbanization changed dramatically as a result of the rise of ocean trade. central place theory can be used as a theoretical framework (and integrated with other frameworks) to understand (not predict) the distribution and pattern of urban places in the world.     models of internal city structure  three classic geographic models can be integrated with more recent variants (city of realms, galactic city, postmodern cities) to describe the varying architecture, street morphology, density and social organization within cities:  concentric zone model (1925): invasion/succession/bid rent curve/peak land value intersections  sector model (1933): development based on transportation routes  multiple nuclei model (1948): growth occurs independently around several different major nodes with little connection to the existing city.    functional character of cities  basic vs. nonbasic employment (location quotient)--the bigger the city the higher the percentage of non-basic employment--in north america it is shifting from mfg to professional services.

Smith)    Important component of environmental justice is not only to change top-down policy but also to inform the residents that may be affected by transportation and other environmental decisions.   Former president Clinton made EJ fedearal policy on 2/11/1994 when he signed the Executive Order 12898.  All major (not sure what organizations fall under this umbrella) federal agencies were directed to establish directives that would follow the spirit of this order in their activities.  US DOT issued their final EJ order on 4/15/1997 which required the following four actions to take place as part of all federally funded transportation-related programs.    1. identify and evaluate environmental, public health, and interrelated social and economic effects  2. propose measures to avoid, minimize, and/or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse environmental and public health effects and interrelated social and economic effects  3. consider alternatives when they would enable disproportionately high and adverse effects to be avoided and/or minimized, and  4. elicit public involvement including soliciting input from affected minority and low-income populations, to consider alternatives    the authors operationalize these rules in a case Waterloo , Iowa case study.  there were a few interesting parts to their study.  first, they used block level data to identify protected populations (protected poulations are minority and low income--see report for specifics).  given that the census does not disclose much demographic information at the block level they used a regression equation and block group data to estimate average incomes by block.    the authors also used two EPA models to measure air pollution--MOBILE and PART.

  abstract = {As urban populations grow, there is a growing need for efficient and sustainable modes, such as bicycling. Unfortunately, the lack of bicycle demand data stands as a barrier to design, planning, and research efforts in bicycle transportation. Estimating bicycle demand is difficult not only due to limited count data, but to the fact that bicyclists are highly responsive to a multitude of factors, particularly seasonal weather. Current estimation methods capable of accurately adjusting for seasonal demand change often require substantial data for ongoing calibration. This makes it difficult or impossible to utilize those methods in locations with minimal continuous count data. This research aims to help mitigate this challenge by developing an estimation method using sinusoidal model to fit the typical pattern of seasonal bicycle demand. This sinusoidal model requires only a single calibration factor to adjust for scale of seasonal demand change and is capable of estimating monthly average daily bicycle counts (MADB) and average annual daily bicycle counts (AADB). This calibration factor can be established using a minimum of two short-term counts to represent the maximum and minimum monthly MADB in summer and winter. To develop the model, this research use data from bike-share systems in four cities and 47 permanent bicycle counters in six cities. Although this model is not suitable for locations with mild or atypical seasons, it successfully models MADB and serves as a useful alternative or supportive estimation method in locations where minimal demand data exist.},

  abstract = {Background To date, nearly all research on physical activity and the built environment is based on self-reported physical activity and perceived assessment of the built environment. Objective To assess how objectively measured levels of physical activity are related with objectively measured aspects of the physical environment around each participant's home while controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Methods Objective measures of the built environment unique to each household's physical location were developed within a geographic information system to assess land-use mix, residential density, and street connectivity. These measures were then combined into a walkability index. Accelerometers were deployed over a 2-day period to capture objective levels of physical activity in 357 adults. Results Measures of land-use mix, residential density, and intersection density were positively related with number of minutes of moderate physical activity per day. A combined walkability index of these urban form factors was significant (p =0.002) and explained additional variation in the number of minutes of moderate activity per day over sociodemographic covariates. Thirty-seven percent of individuals in the highest walkability index quartile met the {$\geq$}30 minutes of physical activity recommended, compared to only 18\% of individuals in the lowest walkability quartile. Individuals in the highest walkability quartile were 2.4 times more likely (confidence interval=1.18\textendash 4.88) than individuals in the lowest walkability quartile to meet the recommended {$\geq$}30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day. Conclusions This research supports the hypothesis that community design is significantly associated with moderate levels of physical activity. These results support the rationale for the development of policy that promotes increased levels of land-use mix, street connectivity, and residential density as interventions that can have lasting public health benefits.},

  abstract = {When attempting to provide lessons for other countries from the successful Israeli COVID-19 vaccine experience, it is important to distinguish between the modifiable and non-modifiable components identified in the article by Rosen, et al. Two specific modifiable components included in the Israeli program from which the US can learn are (a) a national (not individual state-based) strategy for vaccine distribution and administration and (b) a functioning public health infrastructure. As a federal government, the US maintains an often complex web of state and national authorities and responsibilities. The federal government assumed responsibility for the ordering, payment and procurement of COVID vaccine from manufacturers. In designing the subsequent steps in their COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration plan, the Trump administration decided to rely on the states themselves to determine how best to implement guidance provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This strategy resulted in 50 different plans and 50 different systems for the dissemination of vaccine doses, all at the level of each individual state. State health departments were neither financed, experienced nor uniformly possessed the expertise to develop and implement such plans. A national strategy for the distribution, and the workforce for the provision, of vaccine beyond the state level, similar to that which occurred in Israel, would have provided for greater efficiency and coordination across the country. The US public health infrastructure was ill-prepared and ill-staffed to take on the responsibility to deliver {$>$}\,450 million doses of vaccine in an expeditious fashion, even if supply of vaccine was available. The failure to adequately invest in public health has been ubiquitous across the nation at all levels of government. Since the 2008 recession, state and local health departments have lost {$>$}\,38,000 jobs and spending for state public health departments has dropped by 16\% per capita and spending for local health departments has fallen by 18\%. Hopefully, COVID-19 will be a wakeup call to the US with regard to the need for both a national strategy to address public health emergencies and the well-maintained infrastructure to make it happen.},

Furthermore, there is little evidence about the measurement validity of self-report measures of neighborhood-based physical activity. Notably, self-reported neighborhood physical activity has not been validated against combined accelerometer and global positioning system (GPS)\textendash assessed physical activity. Thus, the purpose of this study was to estimate the concurrent validity of a recently adapted tool for capturing self-reported neighborhood-based physical activity (i.e., the Neighborhood International Physical Activity Questionnaire; N-IPAQ). Adults (n = 75) from four Calgary (Alberta, Canada) neighborhoods wore an accelerometer and GPS monitor for 7 consecutive days after which they self-reported their physical activity from the past week using the N-IPAQ. Bland-Altman plots and Spearman correlations estimated the concurrent validity between N-IPAQ and accelerometer/GPS physical activity (estimated for the administrative boundary, 400-m and 800-m radial buffers). The mean (95\% Confidence Interval [CI]) difference between the N-IPAQ and accelerometer/GPS estimated total daily minutes of physical activity differed for the 400-m (1.9 min, -26.2 to 29.9), 800-m (10.6 min, -16.0 to 37.1), and administrative boundary buffers (14.7 min, -11.5 to 41.0). The strongest Spearman correlations were found between the N-IPAQ and 800-m radial buffer accelerometer-captured vigorous-intensity physical activity (r = .41 [95\% CI: .18 to .60]), and the N-IPAQ and administrative boundary accelerometer-captured vigorous-intensity physical activity (r = .43 [95\% CI: .20 to .62]). Our findings suggest that the N-IPAQ provides good estimates of neighborhood-based physical activity and could be used when investigating neighborhood correlates of physical activity.},

Evidence for 1990-95 shows a continuation of: highly focused destinations among immigrants whose race-ethnic and skill-level profiles differ from those of the rest of the population; migration patterns among domestic migrants favoring areas that are not attracting immigrants; and accentuated domestic outmigration away from high immigration areas that is most evident for less educated and lower- income long-term residents. These separate migration patterns are leading to widening divisions by race-ethnicity and population growth across broad regions of the country. These patterns are likely to make immigrant assimilation more difficult and social and political cleavages more pronounced.},

Our data consist of population demographics for 2216 census tracts linked to 354 environmentally undesirable facilities, including toxic release inventory sites, hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities, and other common urban problem sites such as landfills, incinerators, bus garages and sewage treatment plants. Using generalized linear and additive modeling techniques, we find that racial/ethnic demographics, in particular the Hispanic percentage of a tract's population, are significantly associated with the presence of potentially environmentally adverse sites. This leads us to the conclusion that, over the whole metropolitan New York City area, the Hispanic population is proximate to more sites than other populations. At the same time, we find that both Hispanics and African-Americans are more proximate to these sites in the Bronx and Queens. However, we also find indications that Hispanics and African-Americans are less likely to be proximate to the sites in Manhattan. We establish an empirical relationship that warrants additional study in order to establish the causes for the population distribution and whether a basis for a claim of discrimination exists.},

  abstract = {Background Helmet use among bike-share users is low. We sought to characterize helmet-use patterns, barriers to helmet use, and cycling safety practices among bike-share users in Toronto. Methods A standardized survey of public bike-share program (PBSP) users at semi-random distribution of PBSP stations was undertaken. By maintaining a ratio of one helmet-wearer (HW): two non-helmet-wearers (NHW) per survey period, we controlled for location, day, time, and weather. Results Surveys were completed on 545 (180 HW, 365 NHW) unique users at 48/80 PBSP locations, from November 2012 to August 2013. More females wore helmets (F: 41.1\%, M: 30.9\%, p=0.0423). NHWs were slightly younger than HWs (NHW mean age 34.4 years vs HW 37.3, p=0.0018). The groups did not differ by employment status, education, or income. Helmet ownership was lower among NHWs (NHW: 62.4\% vs HW: 99.4\%, p{$<$}0.0001), as was personal bike ownership (NHW: 65.8\%, vs HW: 78.3\%, p=0.0026). NHWs were less likely to always wear a helmet on personal bikes (NHW: 22.2\% vs HW: 66.7\%, p{$<$}0.0001), and less likely to wear a helmet always or most of the time on PBSP (NHW: 5.8\% vs HW: 92.3\%, p{$<$}0.0001). Both groups, but more HWs, had planned to use PBSP when leaving their houses (HW: 97.2\% vs NHW: 85.2\%, p{$<$}0.0001), primarily to get to work (HW: 88.3\% vs NHW: 84.1\%, p=0.19). NHWs were more likely to report that they would wear a helmet more (NHW: 61.4\% vs HW: 13.9\%, p{$<$}0.0001), and/or cycle less (NHW: 22.5\% vs HW: 4.4\%) if helmet use was mandatory. Conclusions PBSP users surveyed appear to make deliberate decisions regarding helmet use. NHWs tended to be male, slightly younger, and less likely to use helmets on their personal bikes. As Toronto cyclists who do not wear helmets on PBSP generally do not wear helmets on their personal bikes, interventions to increase helmet use should target both personal and bike-share users. Legislating helmet use and provision of rental helmets could improve helmet use among bike-share users, but our results suggest some risk of reduced cycling with legislation. R\'esum\'e Contexte Peu d'usagers des services de partage de v\'elos portent le casque. Aussi les auteurs ont-ils cherch\'e \`a caract\'eriser les habitudes du port du casque, les obstacles \`a son utilisation et les pratiques en mati\`ere de s\'ecurit\'e parmi les usagers du service de partage de v\'elos \`a Toronto. M\'ethode Une enqu\^ete normalis\'ee a \'et\'e men\'ee parmi les usagers du programme public de partage de v\'elos (PPPV), \`a diff\'erentes stations, choisies selon une r\'epartition semi-al\'eatoire. Les auteurs, en maintenant constant le rapport de un porteur de casque (PC)/deux non-porteurs de casques (NPC) par p\'eriode d'enqu\^ete, ont neutralis\'e les variables relatives au lieu, au jour, \`a l'heure et au temps (conditions m\'et\'eorologiques). R\'esultats L'enqu\^ete a port\'e sur 545 (180 PC; 365 NPC) usagers diff\'erents, \`a 48/80 stations, de novembre 2012 \`a ao\^ut 2013. Les femmes (F) \'etaient plus nombreuses que les hommes (H) \`a porter le casque (F: 41,1 \%; H: 30,9 \%; p=0,0423). Les NPC \'etaient un peu plus jeunes que les PC (NPC: 34,4 ans en moyenne contre [c.] PC: 37,3 ans en moyenne; p=0,0018). Par contre, il n'y avait pas de diff\'erence entre les groupes quant \`a la situation de l'emploi, aux \'etudes ou au revenu. Le fait de poss\'eder son propre casque \'etait plus faible parmi les NPC (NPC: 62,4 \% c. PC: 99,4 \%; p{$<$}0,0001) que parmi les PC, tout comme le fait de poss\'eder sa propre bicyclette (NPC: 65,8 \% c. PC: 78,3 \%; p=0,0026). Les NPC avaient moins tendance \`a toujours porter un casque sur leur bicyclette personnelle (NPC: 22,2 \% c. PC: 66,7 \%; p{$<$}0,0001) et \`a toujours ou presque toujours porter un casque sur les bicyclettes du PPPV (NPC: 5,8 \% c. PC: 92,3 \%; p{$<$}0,0001). Dans les deux groupes, mais davantage dans celui des PC, les cyclistes avaient pr\'evu recourir au PPPV au d\'epart de la maison (PC: 97,2 \% c. NPC: 85,2 \%; p{$<$}0,0001), surtout pour se rendre au travail (PC: 88,3 \% c. NPC: 84,1 \%; p=0,19). Les NPC \'etaient plus nombreux que les PC \`a indiquer qu'ils porteraient le casque plus souvent (NPC: 61,4 \% c. PC: 13,9 \%, p{$<$}0,0001) et/ou qu'ils feraient moins de bicyclette (NPC: 22,5 \% c. PC: 4,4 \%) si le port du casque devenait obligatoire. Conclusions Les usagers du PPPV ayant particip\'e \`a l'enqu\^ete semblent avoir fait un choix d\'elib\'er\'e quant au port du casque. Les NPC \'etaient en g\'en\'eral des hommes, un peu plus jeunes que les PC et les premiers avaient moins tendance que les seconds \`a porter un casque sur leur bicyclette personnelle. Comme les cyclistes qui ne portent pas de casque sur les bicyclettes du PPPV n'en portent g\'en\'eralement pas sur leur bicyclette personnelle \`a Toronto, les interventions visant \`a accro\^itre le port du casque devraient viser autant les propri\'etaires de bicyclette personnelle que les usagers du service de partage de v\'elos. Toutefois, le fait d'imposer le port du casque et la fourniture de casques de location par voie l\'egislative pourrait certes am\'eliorer le port du casque parmi les usagers du service de partage de v\'elos, mais, d'apr\`es les r\'esultats de l'enqu\^ete, cela pourrait aussi avoir pour cons\'equence de diminuer l'usage de la bicyclette.},

The model takes the form of an expansion in product spline basis functions, where the number of basis functions as well as the parameters associated with each one (product degree and knot locations) are automatically determined by the data. This procedure is motivated by the recursive partitioning approach to regression and shares its attractive properties. Unlike recursive partitioning, however, this method produces continuous models with continuous derivatives. It has more power and flexibility to model relationships that are nearly additive or involve interactions in at most a few variables. In addition, the model can be represented in a form that separately identifies the additive contributions and those associated with the different multivariable interactions.]},

The paper concludes with a brief comment on three themes that should be made central to theorizing; the production of the urban habitat, the rise of civil society, and the question of power.},

  abstract = {Urban living is the new reality for the majority of the world's population. Urban change is taking place in a context of other global challenges-economic globalization, climate change, financial crises, energy and food insecurity, old and emerging armed conflicts, as well as the changing patterns of communicable and noncommunicable diseases. These health and social problems, in countries with different levels of infrastructure and health system preparedness, pose significant development challenges in the 21st century. In all countries, rich and poor, the move to urban living has been both good and bad for population health, and has contributed to the unequal distribution of health both within countries (the urban-rural divide) and within cities (the rich-poor divide). In this series of papers, we demonstrate that urban planning and design and urban social conditions can be good or bad for human health and health equity depending on how they are set up. We argue that climate change mitigation and adaptation need to go hand-in-hand with efforts to achieve health equity through action in the social determinants. And we highlight how different forms of governance can shape agendas, policies, and programs in ways that are inclusive and health-promoting or perpetuate social exclusion, inequitable distribution of resources, and the inequities in health associated with that. While today we can describe many of the features of a healthy and sustainable city, and the governance and planning processes needed to achieve these ends, there is still much to learn, especially with respect to tailoring these concepts and applying them in the cities of lower- and middle-income countries. By outlining an integrated research agenda, we aim to assist researchers, policy makers, service providers, and funding bodies/donors to better support, coordinate, and undertake research that is organized around a conceptual framework that positions health, equity, and sustainability as central policy goals for urban management.},

  abstract = {This paper report results from a national survey of quality of life (QoL), based on 999 people aged 65 or more years living in private households in Britain. The study produced both qualitative and quantitative interview data. The 999 survey respondents were interviewed in their own homes with a semi-structured survey instrument, and 80 were followed-up in greater depth at one and two years after the baseline interview. The material from the in-depth interviews is presented here. The main QoL themes that emerged were: having good social relationships, help and support; living in a home and neighbourhood that is perceived to give pleasure, feels safe, is neighbourly and has access to local facilities and services including transport; engaging in hobbies and leisure activities (solo) as well as maintaining social activities and retaining a role in society; having a positive psychological outlook and acceptance of circumstances which cannot be changed; having good health and mobility; and having enough money to meet basic needs, to participate in society, to enjoy life and to retain one's independence and control over life. The results have implications for public policy, and supplement the growing body of knowledge on the composition and measurement of quality of life in older age.},

  abstract = {In the absence of human activities, biological N fixation is the primary source of reactive N, providing about 90\textendash 130 Tg N year-1 (Tg = 1012 g) on the continents. Human activities have resulted in the fixation of an additional {$\sim$}150 Tg N year-1 by energy production, fertilizer production, and cultivation of crops (e.g., legumes, rice). Some sinks of anthropogenic N have been estimated (e.g., N2O accumulation in the atmosphere; loss to coastal oceans), however due to the uncertainty around the magnitude of other sinks (e.g., retention in groundwater, soils, or vegetation or denitrification to N2) a possibly large portion of the N fixed by humans is missing. While we know that N is accumulating in the environment, we do not know the rate of accumulation. Due to the myriad of effects of excess N on humans, ecosystems, and the atmosphere, and their cascading nature (i.e., one atom of N can have a large number of excess N on humans, ecosystems, and the atmosphere, and their cascading nature (i.e., one atom of N can have a large number of different effects as it is transformed to different N species), this lack of knowledge is unfortunate. There are limited options available to society to reduce the amount of N mobilized by human action because there is, in effect, a N imperative \textemdash{} it is required for food production. As population and per capita consumption of food (especially animal products) increase, more and more N will be converted from unreactive to reactive forms in the future. This is especially true in less developed regions.},

  abstract = {A growing number of cities are implementing bike-sharing programs to increase bicycle use. One of the key factors for the success of such programs is the location of bike stations in relation to potential demand (population, activities and public transport stations). This study proposes a GIS-based method to calculate the spatial distribution of the potential demand for trips, locate stations using location\textendash allocation models, determine station capacity and define the characteristics of the demand for stations. The results obtained are compared with the most commonly used location\textendash allocation modeling approaches: minimizing impedance and maximizing coverage. For the objective of this study, the latter approach is more useful. Diminishing returns are observed in both cases: as the number of stations increases, there is less improvement in the fraction of the population covered and accessibility to stations. Because the spatial structure of the proposed network also plays an important role in bike-station use, an additional accessibility analysis was carried out to calculate the volume of activity to which a station has access. With this analysis, stations that are relatively isolated, and therefore of little use to potential users, can be eliminated.},

What are the strengths and the limitations of the rating system? How might the planning and design of LEED-ND projects contribute to sustainable development and what are the implications for public policy? Purpose: This article examines the extent to which certain planning and design criteria are incorporated in LEED-ND pilot projects. Are there common trends in the planning and design of these projects? What are the policy implications for encouraging sustainable neighborhoods? The article also evaluates the effectiveness with which the rating system contributes to the sustainability of neighborhood-scale projects. Methods: I surveyed LEED-ND registered pilot projects in the United States to examine the extent to which the projects satisfy rating system criteria and used the results of the survey to evaluate the rating system. I also asked developers, designers, and LEED consultants to provide their insights, based on their experience with the certification process of pilot projects. Additionally, I compared projects that expect to achieve LEED-ND gold or higher certification with those that expect to achieve less than LEED-ND gold certification to determine their differences. Results and conclusions: The article shows how the rating system works and reveals which criteria are used most and least in pilot projects. The results also show that projects aiming to achieve LEED-ND gold or platinum certification are more likely to incorporate green construction and technology criteria that improve the efficiency of their use of energy and water, as compared to projects that are trying to be LEED-ND or LEED-ND silver certified. The article concludes with a discussion of the rating system's strengths and limitations and the policy implications of using it. Takeaway for practice: Planners should develop appropriate local approaches for encouraging and promoting sustainable neighborhood development projects, and should consider local conditions as well as the strengths and the limitations of the LEED-ND rating system before making LEED-ND certification required for neighborhood-scale developments in their jurisdictions. LEED-ND certification alone cannot guarantee sustainable neighborhood development.

Travel between Khobar-Dammam metropolitan area of Saudi Arabia and Kingdom of Bahrain is selected for mode choice modeling. The travel on this route can be performed mainly by air travel or private vehicle through King Fahd causeway. The results show that the proposed ensemble gives consistently better accuracies than single models for multinomial choice problems irrespective of number of input variables.

  abstract = {Bicycle usage can be affected by colder weather, precipitation, and excessive heat. The research presented here analyzes the effect of weather on the use of the Washington, DC, bikeshare system, exploiting a dataset of all trips made on the system. Hourly weather data, including temperature, rainfall, snow, wind, fog, and humidity levels are linked to hourly usage data. Statistical models linking both number of users and duration of use are estimated. Further, we evaluate trips from bikeshare stations within one quarter mile of Metro (subway) stations at times when Metro is operating. This allows us to determine whether Metro serves as a back-up option when weather conditions are unfavorable for bicycling. Results show that cold temperatures, rain, and high humidity levels reduce both the likelihood of using bikeshare and the duration of trips. Trips taken from bikeshare stations proximate to Metro stations are affected more by rain than trips not proximate to Metro stations and less likely when it is dark. This information is useful for understanding bicycling behavior and also for those planning bikeshare systems in other cities.},

This question is becoming  increasingly urgent to answer as we face diminishing fossil-fuel  resources and the effects of a changing climate while global cities  continue to compete to be the most vibrant centers of culture,  knowledge, and finance.Jan Gehl has been examining this  question since the 1960s, when few urban designers or planners were  thinking about designing cities for people. But given the unpredictable,  complex and ephemeral nature of life in cities, how can we best design  public infrastructure\textemdash vital to cities for getting from place to place, or  staying in place\textemdash for human use? Studying city life and understanding  the factors that encourage or discourage use is the key to designing  inviting public space.In How to Study Public Life Jan  Gehl and Birgitte Svarre draw from their combined experience of over 50  years to provide a history of public-life study as well as methods and  tools necessary to recapture city life as an important planning  dimension.This type of systematic study began in earnest in the  1960s, when several researchers and journalists on different continents  criticized urban planning for having forgotten life in the city. City  life studies provide knowledge about human behavior in the built  environment in an attempt to put it on an equal footing with knowledge  about urban elements such as buildings and transport systems. Studies  can be used as input in the decision-making process,~ as part of overall  planning, or in designing individual projects such as streets, squares  or parks. The original goal is still the goal today: to recapture city  life as an important planning dimension. Anyone interested in improving  city life will find inspiration, tools, and examples in this invaluable  guide.},

This research addresses this gap and aims to provide conceptual clarity by distinguishing the terms and synthesising the different types of relationships between them. We conducted an extensive literature review, employing bibliometric analysis and snowballing techniques to investigate the state of the art in the field and synthesise the similarities, differences and relationships between both terms. We identified eight different relationship types in the literature and illustrated the most evident similarities and differences between both concepts.},

Tensions at the heart of the nature of cycling remain: on the one hand cycling is frequently viewed as being a risky activity, while on the other hand it is seen as being a way of allowing populations to live healthier lives. Reviewing this dichotomy, the authors in this book consider the ways that cycling is planned and promoted. This is done partly in relation to these issues of risk and health, but also from the broader perspective of behavioural response to the changing nature of cycling. A section on methodologies is also included which outlines the current state-of-the art and points a way to future research.},

  abstract = {Bike-sharing is increasingly becoming more popular. Electric bikes as an emerging transportation technology have extended range and are less physically demanding, compared with regular bicycles, thus they can be incorporated into regular bikesharing systems to attract more users. This study aims at capturing the users' preference, while considering investors' limitations and societal cost and benefits of each mode. The problem is defined as a mixed-integer non-liner problem, with nonlinear objective function and constraints. Because of the computationally challenging nature of the problem, a metaheuristic algorithm based on simulated annealing algorithm is proposed for its solution. The performance of the algorithm is tested in this study and convergence patterns are observed. The main findings of this study which are derived from the hypothetical numerical example, include but are not limited to: (1) the most popular public modes are bus and pedelec, because these two modes (bus and pedelec) are less expensive and have the ability to traverse longer distances in comparison to similar modes (i.e., e-scooter/car and bike), and (2) for small communities with short travel distances (feasible within the ranges of active modes), users would not choose fuel-consuming modes, and thus their choice is insensitive to fuel cost.},

  abstract = {The urban environment has distinctive biophysical features in relation to surrounding rural areas. These include an altered energy exchange creating an urban heat island, and changes to hydrology such as increased surface runoff of rainwater. Such changes are, in part, a result of the altered surface cover of the urban area. For example less vegetated surfaces lead to a decrease in evaporative cooling, whilst an increase in surface sealing results in increased surface runoff. Climate change will amplify these distinctive features. This paper explores the important role that the green infrastructure, i.e. the greenspace network, of a city can play in adapting for climate change. It uses the conurbation of Greater Manchester as a case study site. The paper presents output from energy exchange and hydrological models showing surface temperature and surface runoff in relation to the green infrastructure under current and future climate scenarios. The implications for an adaptation strategy to climate change in the urban environment are discussed.},

Ending the global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic requires implementation of multiple population-wide strategies, including social distancing, testing and contact tracing. We propose a new model that predicts the course of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy. The model considers eight stages of infection: susceptible (S), infected (I), diagnosed (D), ailing (A), recognized (R), threatened (T), healed (H) and extinct (E), collectively termed SIDARTHE. Our SIDARTHE model discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed individuals is important because the former are typically isolated and hence less likely to spread the infection. This delineation also helps to explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the epidemic spread. We compare simulation results with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, and we model possible scenarios of implementation of countermeasures. Our results demonstrate that restrictive social-distancing measures will need to be combined with widespread testing and contact tracing to end the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.},

We examine this presumption by finding the commuting pattern for the Los Angeles region in 1980 which would minimise average commuting time or distance, given the actual spatial distributions of job and housing locations. We find that the amount of commuting required by these distributions is far less than actual commuting, and that variations in required commuting across job locations only weakly explain variations in actual commuting. We conclude that other factors must be more important to location decisions than commuting cost, and that policies aimed at changing the jobs-housing balance will have only a minor effect on commuting.},

Using weekly data by zip code for NYC and a panel data specification including week and zip code fixed effects, we estimate a similar average decline of around 17 percent, which becomes larger when we measure mobility using NYC turnstile data rather than cellphone data.

  abstract = {Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) are a core element of the European Commission's Urban Mobility Package. A bundle of measures combines infrastructure; clean fuels and vehicles; and soft measures to promote walking, cycling and public transport use. Looking at the problems of cities world-wide, one crucial aspect not (yet) adequately addressed is increasing car-ownership, leading to over-consumption of space in cities creating both congestion and parking problems. The City of Bremen's SUMP, which received the 2014 CIVITAS Award and the 2015 SUMP Award, integrates car sharing as a strategic element to reduce car ownership. The ambitious Car Sharing Action Plan from 2009, the first municipal thematic plan on car sharing, set a target of 20,000 car sharing users by 2020 and, more important, the replacement of about 6,000 private cars through the service of car sharing. Annual user surveys in Bremen show that every car sharing car takes 15 private cars off the road. This figure includes only cars that car sharers report giving up after becoming car sharers and does not include car purchases that were avoided by users who may have bought a car if no option had been available. Station-based car sharing, with its wide variety of vehicles and the reliability of pre-reservation (but also the option of spontaneous bookings) has a much higher impact on car ownership than does free-floating car sharing. In its 2010 `momorandum', the European IEE project momo Car Sharing estimated that European cities could be unburdened of the parking needs of 600,000 cars \textendash{} end-to-end a row from London to Athens \textendash{} if other cities applied policies similar to those in Bremen (and also Switzerland). The potential is huge to improve traffic, the environment and quality of life in European cities. This practitioner's report presents municipal policies and activities undertaken in Bremen (1) to exploit the potential of car sharing (e.g. providing mobility hubs and on-street car sharing stations; integration in new urban developments; multi-modal integration; optimising fleet management, information and awareness), (2) to develop quality requirements and (3) to prepare for future developments (e.g. autonomous transport systems). It also clarifies the different roles of station-based and free-floating car sharing and their potential for different types of cities and towns. The presentation will show \textendash{} from the perspective of a municipality \textendash{} how car sharing can be integrated into both advanced sustainable urban mobility planning and into more efficient urban developments. New urban developments with integrated car sharing, bike sharing and high quality public transport do not need as many car parking spaces as conventional developments, creating potential for reducing costs and improving the quality of urban space.},

As of 2015, there were 74 U.S. cities operating bikeshare programs. More than half of these programs are seasonal, meaning they shut down their operations for winter. This study focuses on gathering more knowledge and information relating to winter bikesharing for the United States in terms of understanding users' willingness to use bikeshare programs in harsh winters, and operators' strategies, challenges and best practices for providing bikeshare operations without interruption in cold U.S. cities. Great Rides Bikeshare users in Fargo, North Dakota, were surveyed in October 2015 to understand their willingness to use the bikeshare program in winter and determine factors influencing their ridership. Based on 654 returned survey responses, significant number (70\%\textendash 95\%) of regular, occasional, and infrequent bikeshare users expressed their willingness to use bikeshare program in winter; further, the willingness increased among users in situations when bike paths and sidewalks could be cleared of snow and ice. A second survey was conducted in February 2016 with bikeshare program operators located in other cold U.S. cities that expect snow events, freezing temperatures, and other adverse winter weather conditions and were operational for the 2015\textendash 2016 winter. Expected ridership for bikeshare program during the winter has been observed anywhere between 10 and 30\% of peak summer ridership. Winter bikeshare operational strategies, challenges, and best practices were gathered from 10 out of 14 bikeshare programs that were operated through 2015\textendash 2016 winter. Results from this study can be useful to researchers, and bikeshare operators who want to implement year-round bikeshare operations in cold cities with winter conditions.},

  abstract = {As bicycle commuting grows in the United States, the profile of the white, middle-class cyclist has emerged. This stereotype evolves just as investments in cycling play an increasingly important role in neighborhood transformations. However, despite stereotypes, the cycling public is actually quite diverse, with the greatest share falling into the lowest income categories. Bicycle Justice and Urban Transformation demonstrates that for those with privilege, bicycling can be liberatory, a lifestyle choice, whereas for those surviving at the margins, cycling is not a choice, but an often oppressive necessity. Ignoring these "invisible" cyclists skews bicycle improvements towards those with choices. This book argues that it is vital to contextualize bicycling within a broader social justice framework if investments are to serve all street users equitably. "Bicycle justice" is an inclusionary social movement based on furthering material equity and the recognition that qualitative differences matter.  This book illustrates equitable bicycle advocacy, policy and planning. In synthesizing the projects of critical cultural studies, transportation justice and planning, the book reveals the relevance of social justice to public and community-driven investments in cycling. This book will interest professionals, advocates, academics and students in the fields of transportation planning, urban planning, community development, urban geography, sociology and policy.},

  abstract = {Application of machine learning methods shows a popular attempt to identify the purpose of a trip and mode of travel on Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data. Data selection for the training and test sets is important in these methods. However, the feasibility and effects of choosing these data from different periods of the year are still unknown. This detail is particularly important since collecting data via GPS decreases the burden on participants to such an extent that it can last for seasons which may own distinct features. In order to bridge this gap, this paper employs Aslan \&amp; Zech's test (AZ-test) and Random Forests (RF) successively to investigate the influence of data selection from different seasons for training and test sets. The dataset obtained in a city with distinct seasons, Hakodate, Japan, is used for our empirical analysis. The results of AZ-test suggest that explanatory variables of the two data sets from distinct seasons follow different distributions. Furthermore, it concludes that data set from two-seasons and data set from single season also follow different distributions. However, this test achieves some contradictory results in some cases. Due to this, RF is used to check how the accuracy varies in a further detail. RF confirms the findings by AZ-test in most cases. In addition, RF results show that including GIS features as explanatory variables has positive effect on the identification accuracy while including weather features has negative effect on the identification accuracy.},

  abstract = {Cycling confers transport, health and environmental benefits, and bicycle sharing systems are an increasingly popular means of promoting urban cycling. Following the launch of the London bicycle sharing system (LBSS) in 2010, women and residents of deprived areas were under-represented among initial users. This paper examines how the profile of users has changed across the scheme's first 3 years, using total-population registration and usage data. We find that women still make fewer than 20\% of all `registered-use' LBSS trips, although evidence from elsewhere suggests that the introduction of `casual' use has encouraged a higher overall female share of trips. The proportion of trips by registered users from `highly-deprived areas' (in the top tenth nationally for income deprivation) rose from 6\% to 12\%. This was due not only to the 2012 LBSS extension to some of London's poorest areas, but also to a steadily increasing share of trips by residents of highly-deprived areas in the original LBSS zone. Indirect evidence suggests, however, that the twofold increase in LBSS prices in January 2013 has disproportionately discouraged casual-use trips among residents of poorer areas. We conclude that residents in deprived areas can and do use bicycle sharing systems if these are built in their local areas, and may do so progressively more over time, but only if the schemes remain affordable relative to other modes.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the USA, men who have sex men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV, and black MSM have a substantially higher prevalence of infection than white MSM. We created a simulation model to assess the strength of existing hypotheses and data that account for these disparities. METHODS: We built a dynamic, stochastic, agent-based network model of black and white MSM aged 18-39 years in Atlanta, GA, USA, that incorporated race-specific individual and dyadic-level prevention and risk behaviours, network attributes, and care patterns. We estimated parameters from two Atlanta-based studies in this population (n=1117), supplemented by other published work. We modelled the ability for racial assortativity to generate or sustain disparities in the prevalence of HIV infection, alone or in conjunction with scenarios of observed racial patterns in behavioural, care, and susceptibility parameters. FINDINGS: Race-assortative mixing alone could not sustain a pre-existing disparity in prevalence of HIV between black and white MSM. Differences in care cascade, stigma-related behaviours, and CCR5 genotype each contributed substantially to the disparity (explaining 10{$\cdot$}0\%, 12{$\cdot$}7\%, and 19{$\cdot$}1\% of the disparity, respectively), but nearly half (44{$\cdot$}5\%) could not be explained by the factors investigated. A scenario assessing race-specific reporting differences in risk behaviour was the only one to yield a prevalence in black MSM (44{$\cdot$}1\%) similar to that observed (43{$\cdot$}4\%). INTERPRETATION: Racial assortativity is an inadequate explanation for observed disparities. Work to close the gap in the care cascade by race is imperative, as are efforts to increase serodiscussion and strengthen relationships among black MSM particularly. Further work is urgently needed to identify other sources of, and pathways for, this disparity, to integrate concomitant epidemics into models, and to understand reasons for racial differences in behavioural reporting.

  abstract = {Background The transmission of infectious diseases is dependent on the amount and nature of contacts between infectious and healthy individuals. Confined and crowded environments that people visit in their day-to-day life (such as town squares, business districts, transport hubs, etc) can act as hot-spots for spreading disease. In this study we explore the link between the use of public transport and the spread of airborne infections in urban environments. Methods We study a large number of journeys on the London Underground, which is known to be particularly crowded at certain times. We use publically available Oyster card data (the electronic ticket used for public transport in Greater London), to infer passengers' routes on the underground network. In order to estimate the spread of a generic airborne disease in each station, we use and extend an analytical microscopic model that was initially designed to study people moving in a corridor. Results Comparing our results with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) data collected by Public Health England (PHE) in London boroughs, shows a correlation between the use of public transport and the spread of ILI. Specifically, we show that passengers departing from boroughs with higher ILI rates have higher number of contacts when travelling on the underground. Moreover, by comparing our results with other demographic key factors, we are able to discuss the role that the Underground plays in the spread of airborne infections in the English capital. Conclusions Our study suggests a link between public transport use and infectious diseases transmission and encourages further research into that area. Results could be used to inform the development of non-pharmacological interventions that can act on preventing instead of curing infections and are, potentially, more cost-effective.},

As a model, the sharing economy has been expected to make significant contributions to sustainability, providing new opportunities for entrepreneurship, more sustainable use of resources, and consumer co-operation in tight economic networks. However, in recent years, digital platforms have turned into the most important actors in the global sharing economy, turning global corporations, such as AirBnB, Booking, or TripAdvisor into intermediaries controlling and profiting from most transactions. Focused on accommodation, this paper conceptualizes the sharing economy in comparison to the wider collaborative economy, and discusses its social, economic, environmental, and political impacts in comparison to the sustainable development goals. It concludes that the sharing economy has great potential to make very significant contributions to sustainability, though the model is increasingly being replaced by the collaborative economy, which performs as an extension and acceleration of neoliberal economic practices.},

  abstract = {Mobility growth poses considerable challenges to city planners around the world, as it entails problems of congestion, air pollution, and accidents. Many cities have thus sought to increase the share of sustainable transport, and specifically travel by bicycle. However, it appears that measures to foster cycling are often implemented on an ad hoc basis, lacking strategic focus and a more profound understanding of bicycle cultures. New insights can be gained from Copenhagen, Denmark, a selfdeclared City of Cyclists that has made considerable progress towards increasing the share of travel by bicycle, with the political goal to become the ``world's best city for bicycling''. In this article, the success, reproducibility and limitations of the Copenhagen bicycle strategy are discussed in an urban transport transitions framework, based on a content- and discourse analysis of the city's official documents to assess the respective role of market-based, command-and-control, and soft policy measures in encouraging bicycling. Results suggest that soft policies, integrated with command-and-control measures, and the consideration of bicyclist expectations and concerns with regard to perceptions of safety, speed and comfort have been key in achieving high bicycle trip shares. Integrating these in comprehensive planning frameworks appears to be an approach that is more likely to foster bicycle cultures that can result in urban transport transitions.},

Even with the trend toward suburbanization, many central cities attract substantial new investment and employment. Within this profile of health, however, many urban areas are beset by problems of economic disparity, physical deterioration, and social distress. This volume addresses the condition of the city from the perspective of the larger metropolitan region. It offers important, thought-provoking perspectives on the structure of metropolitan-level decisionmaking, the disadvantages faced by cities and city residents, and expanding economic opportunity to all residents in a metropolitan area. The book provides data, real-world examples, and analyses in key areas:  Distribution of metropolitan populations and what this means for city dwellers, suburbanites, whites, and minorities. How quality of life depends on the spatial structure of a community and how problems are based on inequalities in spatial opportunity--with a focus on the relationship between taxes and services.  The role of the central city today, the rationale for revitalizing central cities, and city-suburban interdependence.  The book includes papers that provide in-depth examinations of zoning policy in relation to patterns of suburban development; regionalism in transportation and air quality; the geography of economic and social opportunity; social stratification in metropolitan areas; and fiscal and service disparities within metropolitan areas.},

METHODS A population-based case-control study was conducted among men aged 25-64 years and residing in Kaunas, Lithuania. The study included all cases of first-time myocardial infarction in 1997-2000. Interviews with patients treated in hospitals elicited information on smoking and other risk factors, including residential histories. A high response rate (77.4\%) resulted in 448 cases and 1777 controls. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was selected for analysis as an indicator of traffic-related air pollution. The annual air pollution levels were estimated for the residential districts; thereafter the data were linked to the home addresses of the cases and controls. RESULTS After adjustment for age, education, smoking, blood pressure, body mass index, marital status, and psychological stress, the risk of myocardial infarction was higher for the men exposed to medium [odds ratio (OR) 1.43, 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.04-1.96] and high (OR 1.43, 95\% CI 1.07-1.92) NO2 levels. The data suggested a stronger association among 55- to 64-year-old men. The risk of myocardial infarction increased by 17\% among the 25- to 64-year-old men (OR 1.17, 95\% CI 1.01-1.35) and by 34\% among those aged 55-64 years (OR 1.34, 95\% CI 1.08-1.67) from the first to the third tertile of NO2 exposure. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that urban NO2 pollution may increase the risk of myocardial infarction and that vehicle emissions may be of particular importance.},

Temporary migrant workers and settled immigrants have accounted for a large number of cases in COVID outbreaks in the workplace.

The methodology used includes a combination of mental maps and interviews for examining perceptions of territorial boundaries, with tracking technology (GPS) and activity diaries to track the actual use of space. This methodology was implemented in a pilot study with a sample of 18 women living in Jerusalem, including secular Jews, ultra-orthodox Jews, and Palestinian Muslims. The study found a very strong relationship between perceived personal territory and actual spatial activity. However, while the secular Jewish women appeared to be completely segregated within their territory, the ultra-orthodox Jewish women and the Palestinian Muslim women were both very active within the secular Jewish territory, but avoided each other's territories. The analysis of mental maps and actual spatial patterns of residential daily activities challenges prevailing notions about the spatial structure of Jerusalem and the internal power relations between the populations that inhabit it. More generally, it provides a new methodological approach for investigating segregation in cities.},

Findings indicate that spatial mismatch is not a problem in the Washington, DC SMSA. 'Mismatch' may, in certain cases, by overly implicated in these outcomes. Perhaps direct employer discrimination or other forms of institutional racism are more important in the outcome of growing racial inequality than the relatively impersonal process of mismatch.

Using data from the 1994 Household Activity and Travel Behavior Survey conducted in Portland, Oregon, these findings suggest New Urbanist concepts serve to increase walking substitution; transit is not affected.

Few studies, however, investigate the role and impact of such online platforms on planning outcomes. We evaluate the impact of participant input via a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS), a platform to suggest the placement of new bike share stations in New York City (NY) and Chicago (IL). We conducted 2 analyses to evaluate how close planners built new bike share stations to those suggested on PPGIS platforms. According to our proximity analysis, only a small percentage of built stations were within 100 feet (30 m) of suggested stations, but our geospatial analysis showed a substantial clustering of suggested and built stations in both cities that was not likely due to random distribution. We found that the PPGIS platforms have great promise for creating genuine co-production of planning knowledge and insights and that system planners did take account of the suggestions offered online. We did not, however, interview planners in either system, and both cities may be atypical, as is bike share planning; moreover, multiple factors influence where bike stations can be located, so not all suggested stations could be built.Takeaway for practice: Planners can use PPGIS and similar platforms to help stakeholders learn by doing and to increase their own local knowledge to improve planning outcomes. Planners should work to develop better online participatory systems and to allow stakeholders to provide more and better data, continuing to evaluate PPGIS efforts to improve the transparency and legitimacy of online public involvement processes.},

This study evaluates local intermodal plan goals using trip data and associated infrastructure such as transit stops and bike share station locations in Austin, Texas, and Chicago, Illinois. Bike sharing use data from both cities suggest a weak relationship with existing rail stations that could be strengthened through collaborative, intermodal planning. The study suggests a planning framework and example language that could be tailored to help address the linkage between bike sharing and transit. Rather than an exhaustive study of the practice, this study provides evidence from these two cities that identify opportunities to improve intermodal planning. Cities that are planning or expanding a bike sharing system should consider carefully how to leverage this mode with existing modes of transport. Regardless of a city's status in implementing a bike sharing system, planners can leverage information on existing transport systems for planning at regional and local levels.},

DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Electronic health record data from 30 pediatric practices with known race/ethnicity. STUDY DESIGN: In a simulation experiment, we constructed dichotomous and continuous outcomes with pre-specified associations with known race/ethnicity. Bias was introduced by nonrandomly setting race/ethnicity to missing. We compared typical methods for handling missing race/ethnicity (multiple imputation alone with clinical factors, complete case analysis, indicator variables) to multiple imputation incorporating surname and address information. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Imputation using U.S. Census information reduced bias for both continuous and dichotomous outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The new method reduces bias when race/ethnicity is partially, nonrandomly missing.},

  abstract = {Background Vaccination is an effective way to prevent infectious diseases. Most studies analysed people's vaccine decisions, but few studies have analysed the effects of convenience such as immunisation schedule and distance and the quality of vaccination service on vaccination uptake. Objective The aim of this paper was to investigate adults' preferences for convenience and quality of vaccination service, calculate the private economic benefit from convenience (vaccination schedule and distance) and quality, and predict the uptake rate for different vaccine scenarios. Methods In our study, we interviewed 266 adults in 2 counties of Shandong province in China. The discrete choice experiment (DCE) was employed to analyse the preference for hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, and a mixed logit model was used to estimate respondent preferences for vaccination attributes included in the DCE. Results The protection rate against hepatitis B (HB), duration of protection, risk of side effects, vaccination cost, schedule, and vaccination sites were proved to influence adults' preferences for HBV vaccination. The estimated willingness to pay (WTP) for 1 dose schedule instead of 3 doses and for a third-level vaccination site instead of a first-level site was almost equal (19 RMB). However, if the protection duration of the vaccination programme changed from 5years to 20years, the adults were willing to pay 35.05 RMB, and WTP for a 99\% protection rate instead of a 79\% rate was 67.71 RMB. The predicted uptake rate is almost 43\% for the base case of HBV vaccination. Conclusions Adults made trade-offs between vaccination schedules, vaccination sites, and other characteristics of HBV vaccine. The impact of attributes of the vaccine itself, especially protection rate against HB, duration of protection, and risk of side-effects, is more dramatic than convenience and quality of vaccination service.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: The online accommodation platform Airbnb has expanded globally, raising substantial planning and regulatory concerns. We ask whether Airbnb rentals generate significant neighborhood impacts like noise, congestion, and competition for parking; reduce the permanent rental housing supply and increase rental prices; or provide income opportunities that help ``hosts'' afford their own housing. We focus on Sydney, the largest region in Australia with 4.4 million people in 28 individual municipalities, which has experienced both rapidly rising housing costs and exponential growth in Airbnb listings since 2011. Airbnb's growth has raised concerns serious enough to result in a formal Parliamentary Inquiry by the state of New South Wales. We analyze stakeholder submissions to this inquiry and review local planning regulations, Airbnb listings data, and housing market and census statistics. We find that online homesharing platforms for visitor accommodations blur traditional boundaries between residential and tourist areas so Airbnb listings may fall outside of existing land use regulations or evade detection until neighbors complain. Our findings are constrained by the difficulties of monitoring online operations and the rapid changes in the industry.Takeaway for practice: Planners and policymakers in cities with increasing numbers of Airbnb rentals need to review how well local planning controls manage the neighborhood nuisances, traffic, and parking problems that may be associated with them while acting to protect the permanent rental housing supply. Local planners need to ensure that zoning and residential development controls distinguish between different forms of short-term Airbnb accommodation listings and their potential impacts on neighborhoods and housing markets.},

Peripheral locations invariably figure as being of low accessibility and consequently as possible receptors for new investments, even though they may already have a very good provision of transport infrastructure. In this paper an accessibility indicator is formulated that neutralizes the effect of geographic location. To this end, the customary notion of distance (length, time, or costs) is substituted by another which expresses the ease of access in terms of network efficiency. This indicator can be useful to assist decisions to invest in transport networks, as it is more sensitive than the potential model to the transport infrastructure needs of each individual region. It has been tested by application to the current Spanish Infrastructure Master Plan.},

The company was just recently established, but it has grown extremely rapidly and is now selling many millions of room nights annually. This rise is examined through the lens of disruptive innovation theory, which describes how products that lack in traditionally favoured attributes but offer alternative benefits can, over time, transform a market and capture mainstream consumers. The concepts of disruptive innovation are used to consider Airbnb's novel business model, which is built around modern internet technologies, and Airbnb's distinct appeal, which centres on cost-savings, household amenities, and the potential for more authentic local experiences. Despite Airbnb's growing popularity, many Airbnb rentals are actually illegal due to short-term rental regulations. These legality issues and their corresponding tax concerns are discussed, with an overview of the current state of regulatory flux and a possible path for resolution. Thereafter, the article considers Airbnb's potential to significantly disrupt the traditional accommodation sector, and the positive and negative impacts Airbnb may have on destinations. Finally, numerous questions for future research are proposed.},

A subsequent cluster analysis divided the respondents into five segments\textemdash Money Savers, Home Seekers, Collaborative Consumers, Pragmatic Novelty Seekers, and Interactive Novelty Seekers. Profiling of the segments revealed numerous distinctive characteristics. Various practical and conceptual implications of the findings are discussed.},

This research explores whether other demographic groups of drivers adopt self-regulatory behaviours and examines the effects of affective and instrumental attitudes on self-regulation across the lifespan. Quantitative data were collected from 395 drivers. Women were significantly more likely than men to engage in self-regulation, and to be negatively influenced by their emotions (affective attitude). A quadratic effect of age on self-regulation was determined such that younger and older drivers reported higher scores for self-regulation than middle-years' drivers. However, this effect was affected by experience such that when experience was controlled for, self-regulation increased with age. Nevertheless, anxious driving style and negative affective attitude were independent predictors of self-regulation behaviours. Results suggest that self-regulation behaviours are present across the driving lifespan and may occur as a result of driving anxiety or low confidence rather than as an effect of ageing.},

  abstract = {The integration of Transportation Demand Management (TDM) policies is a challenging issue in urban policy studies. Interactions between policies that are not addressed broadly in the integration context play a main role in the outcome of TDM policy packages. However, different individual daily trip purposes, city development, variations in land use and different levels of decision making about transportation often lead to the implementation of more than one TDM policy at a time. This study examined the role of TDM policy interactions on the macro and micro levels. On the macro level, this study showed that the introduction of two-way interactions in the model could improve the goodness of fit by 15\%. On the micro level, we developed the concept of synergy for all levels of two policies. The results show that generally synergy is a function of policies' levels, and the integration of increasing parking cost with either cordon pricing or increasing fuel cost has greater synergy at higher levels of the two policies. In contrast, the integration of other two policies (i.e. cordon pricing and increasing fuel cost) had no synergy in the examined ranges.},

  abstract = {A PT system consists of various physical features such as roads, railways, routes, and stops which are represented by a complex network of spatial and temporal data. Since these networks are usually very large and include millions of entities, it is difficult to assess PT systems. Assessment in this context is defined as the ability to extract and analyze data in an automated and recurring process so as to enhance decision making and to make it possible to compare between PT networks over time. The unified methodology that this work presents for extracting, storing and analyzing PT data enables relatively easy spatial analysis with GIS techniques based solely on: (a) Google Transit feeds and (b) Transportation networks. In order to implement this new methodology for analyzing a PT system, five connectivity indicators are introduced: (a) transportation network coverage level; (b) average speed; (c) intersection coverage level; (d) stop transfer potential; and (e) route overlap. This work demonstrates the proposed methodology by analyzing PT systems in Auckland (New Zealand), Vancouver (Canada), and Portland (Oregon, USA).},

  abstract = {The analysis of travel mode choice is an important task in transportation planning and policy making in order to understand and predict travel demands. While advances in machine learning have led to numerous powerful classifiers, their usefulness for modeling travel mode choice remains largely unexplored. Using extensive Dutch travel diary data from the years 2010 to 2012, enriched with variables on the built and natural environment as well as on weather conditions, this study compares the predictive performance of seven selected machine learning classifiers for travel mode choice analysis and makes recommendations for model selection. In addition, it addresses the importance of different variables and how they relate to different travel modes. The results show that random forest performs significantly better than any other of the investigated classifiers, including the commonly used multinomial logit model. While trip distance is found to be the most important variable, the importance of the other variables varies with classifiers and travel modes. The importance of the meteorological variables is highest for support vector machine, while temperature is particularly important for predicting bicycle and public transport trips. The results suggest that the analysis of variable importance with respect to the different classifiers and travel modes is essential for a better understanding and effective modeling of people's travel behavior.},

The study database is created from UITP databank: ``Millennium cities database for sustainable mobility'' or MCDST. Firstly sustainable transportation indicators were selected by reviewing past researches. Some indicators are edited or redefined. Consequently 9 STI were developed, 3 indicators in each 3 groups of environmental, economical and social. Then composite index was also suggested by combination of 9 standardized indicators. According to composite index various cities were compared. Finally some important factors affecting urban transportation sustainability were determined by using correlation analyses between composite index and cities characterizes.},

Research is being directed at making mobile phones and other handheld devices accessible via our haptic (touch) and audio sensory channels. We review research and innovation within the field of mobile assistive technology for the visually impaired and, in so doing, highlight the need for successful collaboration between clinical expertise, computer science, and domain users to realize fully the potential benefits of such technologies. We initially reflect on research that has been conducted to make mobile phones more accessible to people with vision loss. We then discuss innovative assistive applications designed for the visually impaired that are either delivered via mainstream devices and can be used while in motion (e.g., mobile phones) or are embedded within an environment that may be in motion (e.g., public transport) or within which the user may be in motion (e.g., smart homes).},

Studies have revealed various, and in some cases counterintuitive, roles that safety concerns can play in individuals' travel behavior. In addition, characteristics of the physical environment such as land use and walkability are also influential factors in travelers' decisions. This study explored these questions through the study of individual travel behavior by using discrete choice models applied to the reported home-based work trips in the Chicago household travel survey. Mode choice was modeled as functions of variables such as sociodemographics, neighborhood crime density (as a safety measure), and walk score (as a measure of walkability). Different crime types were examined, and a crime index was introduced. Results suggest that both walk score and the crime index at the destination can be considered meaningful predictors of individuals' mode usage. The crime index at origin, however, does not show a significant and meaningful effect.},

CC has been expected to alleviate societal problems such as hyper-consumption, pollution, and poverty by lowering the cost of economic coordination within communities. However, beyond anecdotal evidence, there is a dearth of understanding why people participate in CC. Therefore, in this article we investigate people's motivations to participate in CC. The study employs survey data (N = 168) gathered from people registered onto a CC site. The results show that participation in CC is motivated by many factors such as its sustainability, enjoyment of the activity as well as economic gains. An interesting detail in the result is that sustainability is not directly associated with participation unless it is at the same time also associated with positive attitudes towards CC. This suggests that sustainability might only be an important factor for those people for whom ecological consumption is important. Furthermore, the results suggest that in CC an attitude-behavior gap might exist; people perceive the activity positively and say good things about it, but this good attitude does not necessary translate into action.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: The impact of density on emerging highly contagious infectious diseases has rarely been studied. In theory, dense areas lead to more face-to-face interaction among residents, which makes them potential hotspots for the rapid spread of pandemics. On the other hand, dense areas may have better access to health care facilities and greater implementation of social distancing policies and practices. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect case study to investigate these relationships. Our study uses structural equation modeling to account for both direct and indirect impacts of density on the COVID-19 infection and mortality rates for 913 U.S. metropolitan counties, controlling for key confounding factors. We find metropolitan population to be one of the most significant predictors of infection rates; larger metropolitan areas have higher infection and higher mortality rates. We also find that after controlling for metropolitan population, county density is not significantly related to the infection rate, possibly due to more adherence to social distancing guidelines. However, counties with higher densities have significantly lower virus-related mortality rates than do counties with lower densities, possibly due to superior health care systems.Takeaway for practice: These findings suggest that connectivity matters more than density in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Large metropolitan areas with a higher number of counties tightly linked together through economic, social, and commuting relationships are the most vulnerable to the pandemic outbreaks. They are more likely to exchange tourists and businesspeople within themselves and with other parts, thus increasing the risk of cross-border infections. Our study concludes with a key recommendation that planners continue to advocate dense development for a host of reasons, including lower death rates due to infectious diseases like COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: The impact of density on emerging highly contagious infectious diseases has rarely been studied. In theory, dense areas lead to more face-to-face interaction among residents, which makes them potential hotspots for the rapid spread of pandemics. On the other hand, dense areas may have better access to health care facilities and greater implementation of social distancing policies and practices. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect case study to investigate these relationships. Our study uses structural equation modeling to account for both direct and indirect impacts of density on the COVID-19 infection and mortality rates for 913 U.S. metropolitan counties, controlling for key confounding factors. We find metropolitan population to be one of the most significant predictors of infection rates; larger metropolitan areas have higher infection and higher mortality rates. We also find that after controlling for metropolitan population, county density is not significantly related to the infection rate, possibly due to more adherence to social distancing guidelines. However, counties with higher densities have significantly lower virus-related mortality rates than do counties with lower densities, possibly due to superior health care systems.Takeaway for practice: These findings suggest that connectivity matters more than density in the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Large metropolitan areas with a higher number of counties tightly linked together through economic, social, and commuting relationships are the most vulnerable to the pandemic outbreaks. They are more likely to exchange tourists and businesspeople within themselves and with other parts, thus increasing the risk of cross-border infections. Our study concludes with a key recommendation that planners continue to advocate dense development for a host of reasons, including lower death rates due to infectious diseases like COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Over 100 cities around the world have deployed or have plans to deploy a bike sharing system. Bike-sharing programs enable flexibility to users by providing rentals at a variety of locations, and by facilitating one-way trips. In addition, they positively impact the environment and quality of life. The main contribution of this paper is explaining the factors effecting bike sharing trip generation and attraction. Using usage data from bike sharing systems in Barcelona and Seville, census level demographic data, and the location of points of interest, the authors explain various factors effecting bike sharing usage. They employ a panel regression model estimation strategy. By using two different fixed effects models, they are able to produce consistent estimates of trip generation and attraction factors in the presence of unobserved spatial and temporal variables. The authors find that the relationship between bike sharing and alternative modes of transportation can be complicated. In some settings bike sharing competes with alternative modes of transportation, while one can also argue that in other settings bike sharing complements. Taken together, the findings strongly support the following usage scenario: bike sharing programs in Barcelona and Seville are used mainly for commuting in the morning. In the evening a larger variety of trips purposes drive usage. These evening trips are also shorter and closer to home. The results provide empirical foundation for cities and planners in understanding the key factors contributing to bike sharing usage.},

And yet, justice considerations have traditionally played only a marginal role in transportation decision-making, such as those regarding investment in a new infrastructure project. Considerations of justice stress the plight of disadvantaged populations and thus aim to further equality between groups and individuals, especially equality of opportunities and mobility. But how can such considerations be derived from theories of justice and fairness in ways that make them applicable to real-world situations? In this article we offer a new framework for incorporating justice considerations into decision-making association with transport service provision. Our analytic framework is based on the capabilities approach developed by Sen and Nussbaum. After explaining the essence of this approach, we show how transportation allocation criteria can be derived and then incorporated into de facto decision-making. Finally, we provide a real-world example of the implementation of this approach in the provision of transportation services. \& 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

But while they often advocate telecommuting as a transportation demand management strategy, transportation planners have made little progress toward incorporating telecommuting into transportation forecasts, at least partly because of the limited data available. In this paper we explore four alternative methodologies for forecasting telecommuting and discuss the kinds of data that must be collected before these methodologies can be applied. The first approach is trend extrapolation, using curves of technological substitution. Sufficient data are currently available to produce forecasts, albeit highly uncertain forecasts, using this approach. However, even with better data this approach does not address underlying factors and trends that will affect the future of telecommuting. As a result, we explore three additional approaches that should produce more reliable forecasts but which require new data and knowledge about telecommuting: analyzing the characteristics of telecommuters in contrast to nontelecommuters, analyzing factors affecting the individual choice to telecommute, and incorporating telecommuting into traditional transportation forecasting models.},

This article explores how well the available evidence supports these four propositions and provides an overview of the theory, research efforts, and current debates associated with each of these propositions. This overview shows that the four propositions have not yet been fully resolved: researchers have made more progress on some of these propositions than others, but even in the best cases, our ability to predict the impact of smart growth policies remains limited.},

Because officials lack the data and tools needed to estimate use of facilities, their ability to make evidence-based choices among investment alternatives is limited. This paper (1) summarizes counts of cyclists and pedestrians between 2007 and 2010 at 259 locations in the city of Minneapolis, MN, (2) develops scaling factors for estimating 12-h (6:30 am\textendash 6:30 pm) ``daily'' counts from hourly counts, (3) presents models for estimating non-motorized traffic using ordinary least squares and negative binomial regressions, (4) validates each model using bicycle and pedestrian counts for 85 locations, and (5) estimates non-motorized traffic for every street in Minneapolis, MN. Across all locations, mean pedestrian traffic (51/h) exceeded mean bicycle traffic (38/h) by 35\%. One-hour counts were highly correlated with 12-h ``daily'' counts suggesting that planners may focus on short time scales without compromising data quality. Significant correlates of non-motorized traffic vary by mode and model and include weather (temperature, precipitation), neighborhood socio-demographics (household income, education), built environment characteristics (land use mix), and street (or bicycle facility) type. When controlling for these factors, bicycle traffic increased over time and was higher on streets with bicycle facilities than without (and highest on off-street facilities). Our models can be used by policy-makers to estimate non-motorized traffic for streets where counts are unavailable or to estimate changes in non-motorized traffic associated with other changes in the built environment (e.g., adding bicycle lanes or changing land use).},

The long distance commuter cyclists surveyed are very positive about their commute - pointing to positive experiences, better mood, and stress relief as experiences related to their cycle trip to work. Policy support should devote attention to unlocking the potential that may be embedded in individuals combining their exercise and travel time, budgets to promote active travel to work as well as the role of psychological benefits as a factor in promoting and sustaining cycling practices.},

  abstract = {In this article, we will address the barrier of transportation access for welfare recipients or members of the working poor. Adequate transportation can be a formidable barrier for many reasons, not the least of which are cost and availability. Two-thirds of the new jobs being created by today's health economy are located in the suburbs, but three-fourths of welfare recipients reside in either the inner city or rural areas. And research by Mark Hughes of Public/Private Ventures indicates that the dominance of the suburbs as 'engines of employment growth' is expected to continue. Clearly, many low-income people are limited by their transportation options. Residents of large metropolitan areas with well-developed transit systems may face fewer problems, but they still may face the difficulties of getting from the inner city to a job in the suburbs. Rural folks may face limited close-by job opportunities and limited public transit, and very likely, these potentially lengthy commutes are complicated by day-care arrangements and non-traditional work hours at night or on weekends. The new welfare program has forcused attention on and lent urgency to finding solutions to this 'spatial mismatch' between where the unemployed live and where the potential jobs are. All US department of Transport agencies are undertaking efforts to support welfare-reform initiatives. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) are exploring opportunities to address the accessibility issues faced.},

For negative events, anticipatory utility is strongly negative, reducing the desire to delay bad things (i.e., consumers want to ``get it over with'' to minimize the psychological discomfort), but for positive events, overall anticipatory utility is weakly positive, and therefore does little to reduce consumers' desire to expedite good things. This anticipatory asymmetry happens because when consumers think about a future positive event, they both enjoy imagining it (savoring) while simultaneously disliking the feeling of waiting for it (impatience), but when consumers think about a negative event, they both dislike imagining it (dread) and dislike the feeling of waiting for it. We demonstrate the managerial implications of these findings in a pair of field studies using online advertisements for retirement planning.},

  abstract = {A meaningful interpretation of landscape metrics is possible only when the limitations of each measure are fully understood, the range of attainable values is known, and the user is aware of potential shifts in the range of values due to characteristics of landscape patches. To examine the behavior of landscape metrics, we generated artificial landscapes that mimicked fragmentation processes while controlling the size and shape of patches in the landscape and the mode of disturbance growth. We developed nine series of increasingly fragmented landscapes and used these to investigate the behavior of edge density, contagion, mean nearest neighbor distance, mean proximity index, perimeter-area fractal dimension, and mass fractal dimension. We found that most of the measures were highly correlated, especially contagion and edge density, which had a near-perfect inverse correspondence. Many of the measures were linearly-associated with increasing disturbance until the proportion of disturbance on the landscape was approximately 0.40, with non-linear associations at higher proportions. None of the measures was able to differentiate between landscape patterns characterized by dispersed versus aggregated patches. The highest attainable value of each measure was altered by either patch size or shape, and in some cases, by both attributes. We summarize our findings by discussing the utility of each metric.},

Significantly, no pharmaceutical agents are known to be safe and effective at preventing or treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the resulting illness. This leaves the medical and public health community with only nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to rely on for reducing the burden of COVID-19. These measures aim to reduce disease transmission both locally and globally and include bans on public gatherings, compulsory stay-at-home policies, mandating closures of schools and nonessential businesses, face mask ordinances, quarantine and cordon sanitaire (ie, a defined quarantine area from which those inside are not allowed to leave), among others. The effectiveness of NPIs has been studied theoretically, especially within the context of pandemic influenza, and also through analysis of historical observational data. A common finding of these studies is that implementing NPIs, especially when done rapidly after initial detection of a new contagious pathogen, can reduce transmission.},

Cities noticed that their drivers had real problems to find a parking space easily especially during peak hours, the difficulty roots from not knowing where the parking spaces are available at the given time. Even if this is known, many vehicles may pursue a small number of parking spaces which in turn leads to traffic congestion. The traffic on roads and parking space has been an area of concern in majority of cities. So, parking monitoring is an important solution. To avoid these problems, recently many new technologies have been developed that help in solving the parking problems to a great extent. Firstly, this paper gives an overview about the concept of smart parking system, their categories and different functionalities. Then we present the latest developments in parking infrastructures. We describe the technologies around parking availability monitoring, parking reservation and dynamic pricing and see how they are utilized in different settings. In addition, a theoretical comparison is presented to show advantages and drawbacks of each different smart parking system to discuss results and open directions for future research.},

  abstract = {In recent years, many Canadian urban areas have witnessed a rapid population and economic growth thereby putting sustainable transport and urban form at the forefront of planning initiatives. As a result, the development of strategic transport plans and long-range visioning exercises has become a priority for most cities. Still, proper appraisals of these plans along with funding and implementation have lagged behind. Reasons for this lag can be attributed to the lack of constructive interactions between actors in the decision-making process and of common grounds for policy evaluation. This paper proposes to assess the extent of institutional integration in the appraisal, funding, and implementation of transport policy. For this purpose, a survey was conducted with planners and policy-makers pertaining to the three levels of government (municipal, provincial, federal) in Canada. The survey discussed the existing process for funding and evaluation of transport policy and its associated pitfalls as well as the desired state of policy appraisal. Results show low institutional integration among the three levels of government and weakened regional visions within most urban areas in spite of an increased sensitization of decision-makers and the public regarding the importance of achieving society's goals of sustainability and equity.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) coupled with low-carbon electricity sources offer the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and exposure to tailpipe emissions from personal transportation. In considering these benefits, it is important to address concerns of problem-shifting. In addition, while many studies have focused on the use phase in comparing transportation options, vehicle production is also significant when comparing conventional and EVs. We develop and provide a transparent life cycle inventory of conventional and electric vehicles and apply our inventory to assess conventional and EVs over a range of impact categories. We find that EVs powered by the present European electricity mix offer a 10\% to 24\% decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles assuming lifetimes of 150,000 km. However, EVs exhibit the potential for significant increases in human toxicity, freshwater eco-toxicity, freshwater eutrophication, and metal depletion impacts, largely emanating from the vehicle supply chain. Results are sensitive to assumptions regarding electricity source, use phase energy consumption, vehicle lifetime, and battery replacement schedules. Because production impacts are more significant for EVs than conventional vehicles, assuming a vehicle lifetime of 200,000 km exaggerates the GWP benefits of EVs to 27\% to 29\% relative to gasoline vehicles or 17\% to 20\% relative to diesel. An assumption of 100,000 km decreases the benefit of EVs to 9\% to 14\% with respect to gasoline vehicles and results in impacts indistinguishable from those of a diesel vehicle. Improving the environmental profile of EVs requires engagement around reducing vehicle production supply chain impacts and promoting clean electricity sources in decision making regarding electricity infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Geographers and public health researchers recognize that healthcare accessibility is a multi-dimensional concept contingent upon the interplay of a variety of spatial and non-spatial factors, including geographic distance, cost, availability, and quality of services. Understanding such complex healthcare accessibility issues often calls for broader conceptualizations and methodological apparatus. This will enable the researcher to move beyond treating individuals as subjects to be quantified, mapped and analyzed. Instead, the researcher moves toward viewing individuals as active knowledge producers with complex experiences that can inform and enhance our understandings of healthcare accessibility. In this paper, we use qualitative inquiry to understand the complex and unequal landscapes of healthcare accessibility in the Near Eastside of Columbus, Ohio (USA). We talk with and learn from lower-income residents in the study area to understand their experiences and to challenge the local, dominant discourse which suggests the neighborhood has adequate healthcare accessibility simply because it contains multiple free and low-cost clinics. We move beyond maps and official statistics to focus instead on the everyday lived experiences of individuals as they attempt to access healthcare accessibility in their neighborhood and the larger urban area. Such a shift highlights the important role for qualitative inquiry in critical health geography research. Our work develops multiple narratives and represents the experiential knowledge of multiple individuals to reveal important differences between the observed geographies of health and the reality that lower-income residents actually experience in their everyday lives while searching for quality, affordable, and accessible healthcare.},

  abstract = {This article explores the relationship between `creativity' and `innovation', and the forms and practices of `governance' in an urban context. It examines, in particular, the `double' creativity of governance, both in terms of its potential to foster creativity in social and economic dynamics and to creatively transform its own capacities. It argues that there is no simple equation between the characteristics of a `creative city' and a `creative' mode of urban governance. Instead, the article advocates a multi-level approach to the dimensions of urban governance through which to identify qualities of governance activity, which, in specific contexts, have the potential to encourage creativity and innovation. The article first develops three meanings of creativity and outlines the way these are related to governance activity. A three-level approach to the interacting dimensions of governance is then presented, linking episodes, processes and cultures. This approach is then developed into an evaluative framework through which the creative potentialities of emergent properties of governance practices in specific situations can be explored. In conclusion, the article comments on the kinds of governance infrastructures which may have the capacity to release imaginative and innovative activities in city regions, the kinds of interventions which may help to transform such capacity and the imaginative resources and mobilising power which may help successful innovations to spread from experiment to `mainstream'.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: Efforts to account for the history of public housing in America are fraught with competing narratives. Many scholars, policy analysts, architects, and planners seek explanations for the successes and failures of housing projects from within the program itself. Some argue that projects rise and fall based on the management performance of housing authorities, while others look to racism, concentrated poverty, crime, and other social conditions. For many, the challenges faced by public housing result from the alienating and dehumanizing qualities of modernist architecture. Still, others argue that the Housing Act of 1937 was compromised from the beginning and, thus, produced compromised results. This article acknowledges all of these factors as important yet insufficient to account for overall public housing performance; it reframes the narrative of public housing within broader urban conditions, suggesting that the fate of public housing is intimately tied to the fate of the cities that surround them. Takeaway for practice: Current accounts of the fate of public housing tend to reflect narrow managerial, planning, and architectural concerns. As a result, the literature on public housing insufficiently informs long-term policy decisions and planning practices. Solutions will only emerge when policymakers and planners take into account the impact of capital flight, social disinvestment, and the weak powers of cities to overcome such obstacles. After all, these urban conditions apply as much to recently created HOPE VI neighborhoods as to the high-rise public housing neighborhoods they replaced. Research support: None.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modeling of infectious diseases The spread of infectious diseases can be unpredictable. With the emergence of antibiotic resistance and worrying new viruses, and with ambitious plans for global eradication of polio and the elimination of malaria, the stakes have never been higher. Anticipation and measurement of the multiple factors involved in infectious disease can be greatly assisted by mathematical methods. In particular, modeling techniques can help to compensate for imperfect knowledge, gathered from large populations and under difficult prevailing circumstances. Heesterbeek et al. review the development of mathematical models used in epidemiology and how these can be harnessed to develop successful control strategies and inform public health policy. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.aaa4339 Structured Abstract BACKGROUND Despite many notable successes in prevention and control, infectious diseases remain an enormous threat to human and animal health. The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of pathogens play out on a wide range of interconnected temporal, organizational, and spatial scales that span hours to months, cells to ecosystems, and local to global spread. Some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or persist in environmental reservoirs. Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, human connectivity, population growth, urbanization, environmental and land-use change, as well as changing human behavior, present global challenges for prevention and control. Faced with this complexity, mathematical models offer valuable tools for understanding epidemiological patterns and for developing and evaluating evidence for decision-making in global health. ADVANCES During the past 50 years, the study of infectious disease dynamics has matured into a rich interdisciplinary field at the intersection of mathematics, epidemiology, ecology, evolutionary biology, immunology, sociology, and public health. The practical challenges range from establishing appropriate data collection to managing increasingly large volumes of information. The theoretical challenges require fundamental study of many-layered, nonlinear systems in which infections evolve and spread and where key events can be governed by unpredictable pathogen biology or human behavior. In this Review, we start with an examination of real-time outbreak response using the West African Ebola epidemic as an example. Here, the challenges range from underreporting of cases and deaths, and missing information on the impact of control measures to understanding human responses. The possibility of future zoonoses tests our ability to detect anomalous outbreaks and to estimate human-to-human transmissibility against a backdrop of ongoing zoonotic spillover while also assessing the risk of more dangerous strains evolving. Increased understanding of the dynamics of infections in food webs and ecosystems where host and nonhost species interact is key. Simultaneous multispecies infections are increasingly recognized as a notable public health burden, yet our understanding of how different species of pathogens interact within hosts is rudimentary. Pathogen genomics has become an essential tool for drawing inferences about evolution and transmission and, here but also in general, heterogeneity is the major challenge. Methods that depart from simplistic assumptions about random mixing are yielding new insights into the dynamics of transmission and control. There is rapid growth in estimation of model parameters from mismatched or incomplete data, and in contrasting model output with real-world observations. New data streams on social connectivity and behavior are being used, and combining data collected from very different sources and scales presents important challenges. All these mathematical endeavors have the potential to feed into public health policy and, indeed, an increasingly wide range of models is being used to support infectious disease control, elimination, and eradication efforts. OUTLOOK Mathematical modeling has the potential to probe the apparently intractable complexity of infectious disease dynamics. Coupled to continuous dialogue between decision-makers and the multidisciplinary infectious disease community, and by drawing on new data streams, mathematical models can lay bare mechanisms of transmission and indicate new approaches to prevention and control that help to shape national and international public health policy. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6227/aaa4339/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Modeling for public health. Policy questions define the model's purpose. Initial model design is based on current scientific understanding and the available relevant data. Model validation and fit to disease data may require further adaptation; sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can point to requirements for collection of additional specific data. Cycles of model testing and analysis thus lead to policy advice and improved scientific understanding. Despite some notable successes in the control of infectious diseases, transmissible pathogens still pose an enormous threat to human and animal health. The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of infections play out on a wide range of interconnected temporal, organizational, and spatial scales, which span hours to months, cells to ecosystems, and local to global spread. Moreover, some pathogens are directly transmitted between individuals of a single species, whereas others circulate among multiple hosts, need arthropod vectors, or can survive in environmental reservoirs. Many factors, including increasing antimicrobial resistance, increased human connectivity and changeable human behavior, elevate prevention and control from matters of national policy to international challenge. In the face of this complexity, mathematical models offer valuable tools for synthesizing information to understand epidemiological patterns, and for developing quantitative evidence for decision-making in global health.},

We assume that when the commute journey intensifies, either in terms of distance or frequency, attitudes toward cycling become more positive. Factor analysis reveals three underlying attitudinal factors toward cycling to work: awareness, direct trip-based benefits and safety. The decision to cycle is influenced by the factor ``direct trip-based benefit'' at all distances, whereas the ``awareness'' is influential only over long distances. The decision to cycle every day is again affected by the ``direct benefit'' factor. The factors ``safety'' and ``awareness'' are important over shorter distances. Having a cycling habit increases the likelihood of cycling and a higher frequency of cycling. The perceived opinion of others only affects the mode choice over short distances suggesting indicates mode choice on longer commutes is based on one's own attitudes. These findings indicate that attitudes and other psychological factors have a relatively strong impact on the choice to commute by bicycle.},

  abstract = {Background Isolation of cases and contact tracing is used to control outbreaks of infectious diseases, and has been used for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Whether this strategy will achieve control depends on characteristics of both the pathogen and the response. Here we use a mathematical model to assess if isolation and contact tracing are able to control onwards transmission from imported cases of COVID-19. Methods We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the COVID-19 outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in the number of initial cases, the basic reproduction number (R0), the delay from symptom onset to isolation, the probability that contacts were traced, the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings Simulated outbreaks starting with five initial cases, an R0 of 1{$\cdot$}5, and 0\% transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability; however, the probability of controlling an outbreak decreased with the number of initial cases, when R0 was 2{$\cdot$}5 or 3{$\cdot$}5 and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1{$\cdot$}5 were controllable with less than 50\% of contacts successfully traced. To control the majority of outbreaks, for R0 of 2{$\cdot$}5 more than 70\% of contacts had to be traced, and for an R0 of 3{$\cdot$}5 more than 90\% of contacts had to be traced. The delay between symptom onset and isolation had the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable when R0 was 1{$\cdot$}5. For R0 values of 2{$\cdot$}5 or 3{$\cdot$}5, if there were 40 initial cases, contact tracing and isolation were only potentially feasible when less than 1\% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation In most scenarios, highly effective contact tracing and case isolation is enough to control a new outbreak of COVID-19 within 3 months. The probability of control decreases with long delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.

Therefore, they have become an everyday experience for users where, in addition, users spend time inside. This paper aims to identify the key factors both from a functional and psychological perspective for defining an efficient transport interchange. Since the users' perceptions of their experience are particularly important for achieving the most appropriate policy measures for interchanges, an ad-hoc travellers' satisfaction survey was designed and carried out in three European transport interchanges. The assessment methodology used here \textendash{} Principal Component Analysis \textendash{} is proposed as a useful step-by-step procedure. The results of this research highlight the ambivalent nature of the urban transport interchanges. The key functional aspects identified contribute to make easier the transfer and reduce the waiting time, while the psychological factors make the stay more comfortable for users.},

The problem we study is often called the Merge/Purge problem and is difficult to solve both in scale and accuracy. Large repositories of data typically have numerous duplicate information entries about the same entities that are difficult to cull together without an intelligent ``equational theory'' that identifies equivalent items by a complex, domain-dependent matching process. We have developed a system for accomplishing this Data Cleansing task and demonstrate its use for cleansing lists of names of potential customers in a direct marketing-type application. Our results for statistically generated data are shown to be accurate and effective when processing the data multiple times using different keys for sorting on each successive pass. Combing results of individual passes using transitive closure over the independent results, produces far more accurate results at lower cost. The system provides a rule programming module that is easy to program and quite good at finding duplicates especially in an environment with massive amounts of data. This paper details improvements in our system, and reports on the successful implementation for a real-world database that conclusively validates our results previously achieved for statistically generated data.},

  abstract = {A proper selection of route through the urban area may significantly reduce the air pollution exposure. This is the main conclusion from the presented study. Air pollution exposure is determined for two selected cohorts along the route going from home to working place, and back from working place to home. Exposure is determined with a street pollution model for three scenarios: bicycling along the shortest possible route, bicycling along the low exposure route along less trafficked streets, and finally taking the shortest trip using public transport. Furthermore, calculations are performed for the cases the trip takes place inside as well as outside the traffic rush hours. The results show that the accumulated air pollution exposure for the low exposure route is between 10\% and 30\% lower for the primary pollutants (NOx and CO). However, the difference is insignificant and in some cases even negative for the secondary pollutants (NO2 and PM10/PM2.5). Considering only the contribution from traffic in the travelled streets, the accumulated air pollution exposure is between 54\% and 67\% lower for the low exposure route. The bus is generally following highly trafficked streets, and the accumulated exposure along the bus route is therefore between 79\% and 115\% higher than the high exposure bicycle route (the short bicycle route). Travelling outside the rush hour time periods reduces the accumulated exposure between 10\% and 30\% for the primary pollutants, and between 5\% and 20\% for the secondary pollutants. The study indicates that a web based route planner for selecting the low exposure route through the city might be a good service for the public. In addition the public may be advised to travel outside rush hour time periods.},

Everyone agrees that the numeration of objects and the quantification of the characteristics of some simple systems are very ancient practices encountered in any specific civilisation. Indeed the link between measurement and numeration comes from the beginnings. This is recalled here, as are the links between units and money, between references and authority. Then, the paper identifies and exhibits the different epistemological gaps occurred \textendash{} or occurring \textendash{} in the history of measurement in the western countries: geometry versus arithmetics, model versus experiment, prediction versus uncertainty, determinism versus quantum physics. Those gaps are described in relationship to the evolution of the internationally agreed system of units.},

Exclusionary processes are, of course, multi-dimensional and a mixture of physical barriers, financial constraints, time budgets, access difficulties and psychological aspects such as fear, all combine in various ways to prevent the use of transport facilities.  In order to be able to understand more accurately the relationship between transport and social exclusion, a fuller understanding is required.  Data gathered from households to examine the problems experienced by women, the elderly, and disabled, and public transport users in accessing key facilities and influences on lifestyle. Interviews of policymakers and public transport providers provides insights into the problems of providing public transport to meet social inclusion objectives. This book illustrates the nature of these exclusionary processes and indicates how policy and practice could be developed to counter these effects.},

Following a discussion of how social exclusion is defined the article moves to explain how this term has come to be associated with transport. Despite many definitions in the literature some agreement has emerged. This has been augmented by the use of dimensional frameworks that seek to identify the impact of social exclusion on the range of key activities in daily life. Connections between social exclusion and transport disadvantage are then presented. Particular groups in society have become associated with debates about transport disadvantage, including low-income groups, women, and the disabled. Poor transport access also has serious impacts on particular activities, including access to goods and services, education, and jobs. A range of transport policy approaches and nontransport solutions have been developed that seek to reduce the impact of social exclusion and improve levels of personal mobility and access to goods and services. The article discusses the development of bus policy and more specialized transport solutions that are used to improve mobility.},

The relative intensities of the inelastic tunneling processes are consistent with dipolar interactions, as seen for inelastic neutron scattering. First-principles calculations indicate that the magnetic atoms become incorporated into a polar covalent surface molecular network in the copper nitride. These structures, which provide atom-by-atom accessibility via local probes, have the potential for engineering anisotropies large enough to produce stable magnetization at low temperatures for a single atomic spin.},

Then, based on primary sources, it discusses the emergence of three methods of residential segregation through zoning which took root in the early twentieth-century USA. The three methods are: segregating people by race, segregating them by different land-area standards, and segregating them based on both land-area standards and a taxonomy of single- versus multi-family housing.},

In these projects, class interests tend to be obscured by the contemporary preoccupation with the class-ambiguous category of "community". Through a case study of a project of urban redevelopment at King's Cross in London, we conceptualize and map class interests in an urban redevelopment project. Three aspects of the planning process that contain clear class effects are looked at: the amount of office space, the flexibility of plans, and the appropriation of the urban environment as exchange or use value. These aspects structure the urban redevelopment but are external to the communicative planning process. The opposition to the redevelopment has in the planning discourse been articulated as "community"-based rather than in class-sensitive terms. We finally present three strategies for reinserting issues of class into planning theory and practice.},

It is possible, however, that employment decentralization was a temporary shock to inner-city labor markets and that labor supply has successfully adjusted by residential relocation and alterations in job search patterns. This paper examines this issue with an empirical analysis of the 1980 and 1990 employment probabilities of black and white male teenagers living in the largest metropolitan areas of the US. Findings indicate that the impact of job accessibility on employment probabilities declined between 1980 and 1990, especially for black male teenagers not enrolled in school. Accessibility had a declining effort for this group because of losing the advantage of accessibility rather than overcoming the disadvantage of inaccessibility. By 1990, black male teens living in job- accessible areas no longer enjoyed as much of an employment advantage relative to teens living in job-inaccessible areas as they did in 1980.},

This is accomplished by using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, along with data on job and population decentralization in metropolitan areas from the 1980 Census of Population. These results show that blacks and central-city residents face higher time costs of travel than others, at least partly because of their lower access to automobiles. They also find that central-city residents in metropolitan areas where jobs are more decentralized do not offset the loss of jobs in their areas with more geographically extensive job search or longer commutes to work, even after they control for travel cost per mile. High travel costs and reduced travel distances appear to raise unemployment durations and lower wages for blacks. On the other hand, the estimated magnitudes on most of these relationships are not large, which implies that the high cost of travel is just one of many causes of persistent spatial mismatch.},

  abstract = {The output of any Geographic Information System (GIS) is a representation of the real world and, as such, it will always contain some level of uncertainty. There is now a growing recognition that this uncertainty should be communicated to information consumers if they are to be fully informed regarding the decisions being made on the basis of the underlying data. Research to date has tended to focus on the issues of how uncertainty information can be modeled and visualized, with less consideration being given to the subject of how users might apply such information. Studies in the psychological literature clearly indicate decision-making biases when information is ambiguous, with most people displaying ambiguity aversion. Therefore, the research question we seek to answer in this paper is ``Do people exhibit a similar bias towards uncertain spatial information?'' This paper examines the effects of introducing thematic uncertainty to spatial information in the context of a decision task. The results indicate that many people, including those who consider themselves to be experienced in working with spatial information, do not have an intuitive understanding of how to handle uncertainty in decision-making. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the inclusion of uncertainty information in a GIS output can lead to irrational decisions being made\textemdash instead of promoting robust, more fully informed decision-making as intended.},

During this time-period, there has been an on-going debate regarding how one should measure excess commuting in urban regions.

We demonstrate how scale and unit definition (the modifiable areal unit problem) are manifested in the assessment of excess commuting, both in theoretical and empirical terms. To this end, a geographical information systems-based analysis is presented which explores spatial sensitivities in the excess commuting measure. Our results show that aggregation and spatial unit definition may have profound impacts on the estimation of excess commuting. This work provides a formal resolution to much of the recent debate regarding estimates of excess commuting in urban regions.},

Some researchers have examined how these new business models shape market mechanisms and, in the case of home sharing, economists have examined how the sharing economy affects the hotel industry. There is currently limited evidence on whether home sharing affects the housing market, despite the obvious overlap between these two markets. As a result, policy makers grappling with the effects of the rapid growth of home sharing have inadequate information on which to make reasoned policy decisions. In this paper, we add to the small but growing body of knowledge on how the sharing economy is shaping the housing market by focusing on the short-term effects of the growth of Airbnb in Boston neighborhoods on the rental market, relying on individual rental listings. We examine whether the increasing presence of Airbnb raises asking rents and whether the change in rents may be driven by a decline in the supply of housing offered for rent. We show that a one standard deviation increase in Airbnb listings is associated with an increase in asking rents of 0.4\%.},

Instead, Mouffe advocates `agonistic pluralism', a dynamic process of continual debate grounded in mutual respect. In this paper I argue that, for this to succeed, we need to recognize and embrace the role of emotion in moral reasoning. Here, I examine a dispute over wetland management in suburban New Jersey. Each side articulated distinct understandings of what was and was not vulnerable, backed by emotional appeals partly based in self-interest but that also encompassed care and concern for others. Each side accused the other of being irrational and immoral, drawing `moral microboundaries' between them. I conclude that participants in a public debate may not simply be pursing self-serving goals, nor might open communication resolve their differences. Instead, each may be deeply convinced that he or she is advocating the most rational and moral course of action. This questions the very notion of a unitary, potentially agreed-upon `common good' and instead challenges us to attempt to grasp each other's moral worlds, and in particular the emotional bases of these, through the seeming oxymoron that I term `empathic agonism'.},

The Harbor Communities Time Location Study (HCTLS) examines the nature, extent and implications of underreported locations/trips in a case study which used portable Global Positioning Systems (GPS) devices to track the diurnal patterns and traffic exposure of 47 residents of communities near the Los Angeles\textendash Long Beach port complex. Participants were similar to adults nationwide in time spent indoors, in-vehicle, and outdoors, but spent more time indoors at home (78\% vs. 66\%). Overall, participants did not report nearly half (49\%) of the locations and trips identified in GPS-enhanced data on their activity diaries, resulting in about 3 h/day in unreported locations and 0.6 h/day in unreported trips. The probability of a location/trip being underreported was systematically correlated with participant and location/trip characteristics. Self-reported data missed about 50 min of heightened air pollution exposures during the 5 h/day on average participants spent in high-traffic areas and about 30 min during the 4 h/day near truck routes. GPS-enhanced methods provide opportunities to more precisely characterize exposure periods and tools to identify facility, roadway, and land use types of the greatest concern for mitigation efforts.},

  abstract = {Although pacifism and nonviolence bear a close relationship to one another historically, pacifism is the ideological assertion that war and violence should be rejected in political and personal life, whereas nonviolence refers to a distinct set of political practices. Unlike other modern ideologies such as liberalism and socialism, pacifism has never gained widespread acceptance among a significant portion of humanity and seems to remain a minority position among most of the peoples of the world. Even among those who use nonviolent techniques, the conventional wisdom that physical violence is necessary under certain circumstances often prevails. However, a growing body of empirical evidence shows that the methods of nonviolence are more likely to succeed than methods of violence across a wide variety of circumstances and that more people are using nonviolence around the world. At the same time, both the effectiveness of military and material superiority in achieving political ends and the incidence of warfare and violence appear to be waning. In a remarkable example of convergence between empirical social science and political theory, explanations for the effectiveness of nonviolence relative to violence point to a people-centered understanding of power. This research can provide a basis for a reinvigorated and pragmatic brand of pacifism that refocuses the attention of political scientists on the organization, actions, and loyalties of people as opposed to technologies of domination and destruction.},

The system operates in real-time in several stages on multiple processors, fusing detected road markings, obstacles, and curbs into a stable non-parametric estimate of nearby travel lanes. The system incorporates elements of a provided piecewise-linear road network as a weak prior. Our method is notable in several respects: it detects and estimates multiple travel lanes; it fuses asynchronous, heterogeneous sensor streams; it handles high-curvature roads; and it makes no assumption about the position or orientation of the vehicle with respect to the road. We analyze the system's performance in the context of the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. With five cameras and thirteen lidars, our method was incorporated into a closed-loop controller to successfully guide an autonomous vehicle through a 90 km urban course at speeds up to 40 km/h amidst moving traffic.},

  abstract = {In order to predict the air quality impact by vehicle emissions within an urban street canyon, a two-dimensional air quality numerical model was developed based on atmospheric convection diffusion equations and a k\textendash{$\epsilon$} turbulent model. The numerical model has been evaluated using the database from a set of street canyon air tracer experiments carried out near the crossing of Aoyama ichome, Minato-ku, Tokyo in December 1980, by the Japan Environmental Management Association of Industry (JEMAI). Twenty-four cases have been studied for the sensitivity analysis, including more practical cases when the inflow wind has an inclination with the horizontal road and the two buildings have different heights. As a result, it has been shown that the concentration distributions of pollutants emitted from the street are governed by both the inflow wind and the street canyon geometry. A stable vortex was formed within the street canyon, which agrees with other researchers. Pollutant concentrations were predicted to have higher values on the leeward side compared to the windward side. It was concluded that the released pollutants from street canyon become more diluted in the following cases: a lower height of the street canyon, a faster wind speed, a higher height of the leeward building than the windward building and an inflow wind direction towards the street. It is also suggested that the numerical model is useful for predicting the air quality within a typical urban street canyon.},

Where potential patients can access care, local facilities must ensure they can appropriately diagnose, treat, and contain disease spread to prevent secondary transmission; where patients cannot readily access facilities, alternate plans must be developed. Here, we use travel time to link facilities and populations at risk of viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) and identify spatial variation in these respective preparedness demands.},

The ecological norm orientation is conceptualized based on the Schwartz theory on altruistic behavior, which is then applied to the environmental context. In a random sample of 160 persons, fare was experimentally manipulated by distributing free public transport tickets, whereas the station range was varied by selecting test participants at different distances from a station. Within the norm activation model, the mobility-specific personal ecological norm proves to be the strongest predictor of travel mode choice as recorded in standardized questionnaires. Reducing the fare by distributing free tickets has a quantitatively similar effect. The results suggest that the ``economy-plus-moral'' formula best describes the fact that the integrative mechanism (external factor fare plus normative ecological orientation) is the determinant of travel mode choice.},

We analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of COVID-19 transmission among train passengers to elucidate the associations between infection, spatial distance, and co-travel time. The attack rate in train passengers on seats within a distance of 3 rows and 5 columns of the index patient varied from 0 to 10.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 5.3\% \textendash{} 19.0\%), with a mean of 0.32\% (95\%CI 0.29\% \textendash{} 0.37\%). Passengers in seats on the same row as the index patient had an average attack rate of 1.5\% (95\%CI 1.3\% \textendash{} 1.8\%), higher than that in other rows (0.14\%, 95\%CI 0.11\% \textendash{} 0.17\%), with a relative risk (RR) of 11.2 (95\%CI 8.6 \textendash 14.6). Travellers adjacent to the index patient had the highest attack rate (3.5\%, 95\%CI 2.9\% \textendash{} 4.3\%) of COVID-19 infections (RR 18.0, 95\%CI 13.9 \textendash{} 23.4) among all seats. The attack rate decreased with increasing distance, but it increased with increasing co-travel time. The attack rate increased on average by 0.15\% (p = 0.005) per hour of co-travel; for passengers at adjacent seats, this increase was 1.3\% (p = 0.008), the highest among all seats considered. COVID-19 has a high transmission risk among train passengers, but this risk shows significant differences with co-travel time and seat location. During disease outbreaks, when travelling on public transportation in confined spaces such as trains, measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, including increasing seat distance, reducing passenger density, and use of personal hygiene protection.},

  abstract = {Precise measurement of physical activity is important for health research, providing a better understanding of activity location, type, duration, and intensity. This article describes a novel suite of tools to measure and analyze physical activity behaviors in spatial epidemiology research. We use individual-level, high-resolution, objective data collected in a space-time framework to investigate built and social environment influences on activity. First, we collect data with accelerometers, global positioning system units, and smartphone-based digital travel and photo diaries to overcome many limitations inherent in self-reported data. Behaviors are measured continuously over the full spectrum of environmental exposures in daily life, instead of focusing exclusively on the home neighborhood. Second, data streams are integrated using common timestamps into a single data structure, the ``LifeLog.'' A graphic interface tool, ``LifeLog View,'' enables simultaneous visualization of all LifeLog data streams. Finally, we use geographic information system SmartMap rasters to measure spatially continuous environmental variables to capture exposures at the same spatial and temporal scale as in the LifeLog. These technologies enable precise measurement of behaviors in their spatial and temporal settings but also generate very large datasets; we discuss current limitations and promising methods for processing and analyzing such large datasets. Finally, we provide applications of these methods in spatially oriented research, including a natural experiment to evaluate the effects of new transportation infrastructure on activity levels, and a study of neighborhood environmental effects on activity using twins as quasi-causal controls to overcome self-selection and reverse causation problems. In summary, the integrative characteristics of large datasets contained in LifeLogs and SmartMaps hold great promise for advancing spatial epidemiologic research to promote healthy behaviors.},

  abstract = {Transport choices must be transformed if we are to cope with sustainability and climate change, but this can only be done if we understand how complex transport systems work. Straightforward choices are never made between one transport mode and another; door-to-door movements of both people and freight use combinations of different modes of transport.  This book offers a cross-disciplinary overview of transport systems and the ways in which they interact with urban and regional planning decisions and environmental issues. It offers a thoughtful critique of existing methodology and policy, raising issues, providing facts, explaining linkages and, particularly,~stimulating debate. The book methodically explores the definitions, trends, problems, objectives and policies of transport planning. In particular the author looks at land use as a major determinant of the nature and extent of the demand for transport, concluding that the management of land use has to be a key element of any sustainable transport policy.  Planning Sustainable Transport will be essential reading for today's transport specialists, planners and property developers. It will also be useful to postgraduate students in planning and related disciplines.},

  abstract = {Gentrification has inspired considerable debate, but direct examination of its uneven evolution across time and space is rare. We address this gap by developing a conceptual framework on the social pathways of gentrification and introducing a method of systematic social observation using Google Street View to detect visible cues of neighborhood change. We argue that a durable racial hierarchy governs residential selection and, in turn, gentrifying neighborhoods. Integrating census data, police records, prior street-level observations, community surveys, proximity to amenities, and city budget data on capital investments, we find that the pace of gentrification in Chicago from 2007 to 2009 was negatively associated with the concentration of blacks and Latinos in neighborhoods that either showed signs of gentrification or were adjacent and still disinvested in 1995. Racial composition has a threshold effect, however, attenuating gentrification when the share of blacks in a neighborhood is greater than 40 percent. Consistent with theories of neighborhood stigma, we also find that collective perceptions of disorder, which are higher in poor minority neighborhoods, deter gentrification, while observed disorder does not. These results help explain the reproduction of neighborhood racial inequality amid urban transformation.},

However in both years, work trips to destinations outside the central city penalize African American women relative to European American women. If employment opportunities, especially service jobs, continue to expand in suburban locations and not in central-city locations, the African American women who have to reverse commute (even when they use a car) are unlikely to enjoy the relative convenience of short commutes that characterize the journey-to-work behavior of European American women with suburban employment.},

This article argues that an environmental justice approach can help illuminate the impacts of technology and material flows. To do so, however, environmental justice definitions and methodologies need to account for how and why such flows occur. Using the case of computers, the article analyses some factors shaping the e-waste recycling chain, shows how e-waste risks depend on design and manufacturing chains, and evaluates inequalities in the ecological and health impacts of e-wastes across Asia. It proposes a definition of environmental justice as obviating the production of risk, using a framework that brings together the global production system, development models, and regulatory action.},

We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records. Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes's rule to combine the Census Bureau's Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available. We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6\% and 3\%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80\%. Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates. We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology.},

Methods that were considered include K-nearest neighbor, support vector machines (SVMs), and tree-based models that comprise a single decision tree, bagging, and random forest (RF) methods. For training and validating purposes, data were obtained from smartphone sensors, including accelerometer, gyroscope, and rotation vector sensors. K-fold cross-validation as well as out-of-bag error was used for model selection and validation purposes. Several features were created from which a subset was identified through the minimum redundancy maximum relevance method. Data obtained from the smartphone sensors were found to provide important information to distinguish between transportation modes. The performance of different methods was evaluated and compared. The RF and SVM methods were found to produce the best performance. Furthermore, an effort was made to develop a new additional feature that entails creating a combination of other features by adopting a simulated annealing algorithm and a random forest method.},

  abstract = {Bicycle Sharing Systems (BSS) are rapidly being implemented globally providing a low-cost active transport option that extends travel distances with greater flexibility than other transport modes. The role a BSS plays in a city can be characterised by the type of users and their trip purposes, but little is known about how use changes over time or the factors impacting change. This longitudinal case study identifies trends in BSS patronage disaggregated by types of users and examines how policies (e.g., helmets, public transport fares) can affect usage by different user types. Time-stamped origin and destination trip data for the Melbourne Bike Share System (MBSS) from 2010 to 2016 was analyzed to identify trends by casual users and long-term subscribers (LTS). Overall, usage increased marginally, but the proportion of casual trips increased from 50\% (in 2010) to 80\% (in 2016). Policy changes within the MBSS area (e.g., provision of courtesy helmets, the introduction of a Free Tram Zone (FTZ)) affected use by the two types of users differently. However, the initial system objectives and system architecture have not changed in response. Usage by the two market segments by socio-demographic and geographic variables highlighted that both user groups correlated strongly with proximity to major transport hubs. However, while LTS usage is positively correlated with proximity to high-density employment districts, casual usage is positively correlated with the availability of separate bicycle lanes and paths and proximity to tourism destinations. Findings underline the importance of understanding BSS use by market segments and reviewing BSS policy, objectives, planning and design to adequately respond to changing user needs and manage the future evolution of BSS.},

  abstract = {IntroductionThe aim of this paper is to explore the equity principles in three main domains of government intervention (health, education and especially housing) and to draw lessons for the domain of transport. In line with the burgeoning literature, we consider equity in transport to be primarily \textendash{} albeit not only \textendash{} concerned with the level of accessibility conferred by the transport-land use system to persons. While some (recent) research has explored what requirements of fairness may imply for accessibility the issue has received scant attention in the practice of transport planning and policy. In contrast, equity principles are fairly well established in the domains of health care, education and housing. By analyzing the equity principles in each of the latter domains, and assessing their possible relevance for the domain of transport, we want to contribute to the rapidly growing literature addressing equity concerns in the domain of transport.MethodsThe paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we conduct a thought experiment with the aim to provide a rough first estimate of the population at risk of what we call accessibility poverty. In the second part of the paper, we contrast the (lack of) equity principles in the transport domain with the type of equity principles underpinning three domains of government intervention: health care, education, and housing. We have selected these domains, because in contrast to transport, they are generally considered key anchors of developed welfare states; and in parallel to transport, they are each concerned with the delivery of a particular good to citizens.ResultsWe estimate that in developed (Northern-European) countries about 9\% to 11\% of households is at risk of accessibility poverty. Of this group, 7\% of all households is at risk because of a poor transport system (and sometimes also because of affordability problems), while another 2\% to 4\% is at risk of accessibility poverty because of disproportionally high motoring costs. We observe that most Western societies have well-established policies regarding the fair provision of health care, education and housing for all (income) groups. In contrast, decision-makers have not even started to define what fairness in the domain of transport could amount to.ConclusionGiven the importance of mobility in modern societies, we argue that there is an urgent need for societal and policy debates about fairness and for subsequent translation of the outcomes of these debates into adequate principles, standards, and policies for the transport domain.},

  abstract = {As an integral part of the emerging sharing economy, ridesourcing refers to transportation services that connect community drivers with passengers via mobile devices and applications. The spectacular growth of ridesourcing has sparked a burgeoning literature discussing how it affects the future of cities. This paper presents a systematic review of the existing literature concerning the impact of ridesourcing on the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of urban development. Ridesourcing has a positive impact on economic efficiency. It both complements and competes with public transit, but its influence on traffic congestions near city centers is still unclear. Regarding urban equity, ridesourcing further amplifies the issue of the digital divide and raises concerns over the issues of discrimination and data privacy and security. It is also hotly contested whether prosumers (producers/ consumers) are exploited by the sharing economy platforms, whether ridesourcing drivers are reasonably compensated, and how to better protect on-demand workers' rights. Even though ridesourcing has been promoting a green image, its true environmental impact has not been thoroughly investigated. According to the evidence reported in the literature so far, it is unlikely that ridesourcing will reduce private car ownership. Ridesourcing's impacts on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are uncertain based on existing research. This paper outlines the danger of conceptual confusion and the methodological issues in the existing literature. Further research is sorely needed as the future of cities is indisputably tied to the sharing economy and its impacts on shared mobility.},

  abstract = {A marriage between public bicycle and rail transit presents new opportunities for sustainable transportation in Chinese cities. To examine determinants of public bicycle usage for rail transit access, an intercept survey of feeder mode choice among rail transit users was conducted near rail stations in Nanjing, China. Mode choice models were estimated with five feeder mode alternatives, including car, bus, walk, private bike, and public bike. By differentiating between public and private bicycle modes in the mode choice models, the study reveals the effects of personal demographics, trip characteristics, and station environments on public bicycle usage for rail transit access. Results show that female, older, and low-income rail commuters are less likely to use public bicycle to access rail transit. Rail commuters with bicycle theft experience and making school- or work-related trips are more likely to use public bicycle to access rail transit. Land use variables are largely insignificant in this study except that density shows a positive relationship with walking to rail transit. The results on demographic differences raise equity concerns when it comes to investing in public bicycle systems. Policy implications are discussed for Chinese cities to equitably boost public bicycle integration with rail transit.},

  abstract = {Gradual expansions to the express coach and rail system since 2006 have provided millions of Americans new alternatives to private automobile travel in intercity trips. The expansion of services by Amtrak, BoltBus, and Megabus, as well as various small express coach lines, helped create a more balanced transportation system on many city-to-city routes. More than a decade after this expansionary period began, however, many routes still lack options that many travelers seeking to avoid flying or driving would consider minimally acceptable. Through a review of the status of express coach and intercity rail service, this study shows: \textbullet{} Despite the momentum behind rail and bus services in recent years, prominent ``Ground Transportation Gaps'' remain, leaving travelers without practical alternatives to automobile and air travel. Although conventional bus service, such as Greyhound, may be available, the absence of express coach lines and Amtrak leave many to regard themselves as having no choice but to fly or drive. \textbullet{} Among the short- and mid-distance routes without rail or express coach service generating more than one million trips per year are Los Angeles \textendash{} Phoenix, Cleveland \textendash{} Detroit, Columbus, OH \textendash{} Detroit, Chicago \textendash{} Columbus, OH, and Phoenix \textendash{} San Diego. Numerous routes generate more than one million passenger trips annually. \textbullet{} Nine metropolitan areas with populations of 700,000 or more lack any service by Amtrak or express coach lines. These ``Pockets of Pain,'' such as Phoenix, Columbus (OH) and Dayton, Tulsa, and Ft. Myers and Sarasota, are largely inaccessible to intercity travelers who seek to avoid flying or driving but are unwilling to use conventional bus lines. The study calls for practical steps to restore momentum to bus and rail travel that require a relatively small amount of public investment, including ways to cultivate new express coach service and promote greater rail/bus integration. It also calls for initiatives to overcome the lack of institutional planning and investment that is thwarting planning for rail services that cross state lines and thus require a great deal of interjurisdictional coordination. Such efforts, the study shows, would help foster more fuel-efficient and comparatively safe forms of travel.},

Mobile phone data have been collected in eight cities in Northeast China and used to extract individuals' movement trajectories. The massive mobile phone data provides a wide coverage and detailed depiction of individuals' movement in space and time. Considering that most individuals' movement is limited within particular urban areas, boundaries of urban agglomerations are demarcated based on the spatial distribution of mobile phone base towers. Results indicate that the distribution of human's intra-urban travel in general follows the exponential law. The exponents, however, vary from city to city and indicate the impact of city sizes and shapes. Individuals living in large or less compact cities generally need to travel farther on a daily basis, and vice versa. A Monte Carlo simulation analysis based on Levy flight is conducted to further examine and validate the relation between intra-urban human mobility and urban morphology.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: This study developed and tested an algorithm to classify accelerometer data as walking or nonwalking using either GPS or travel diary data within a large sample of adults under free-living conditions. METHODS: Participants wore an accelerometer and a GPS unit and concurrently completed a travel diary for seven consecutive days. Physical activity (PA) bouts were identified using accelerometry count sequences. PA bouts were then classified as walking or nonwalking based on a decision-tree algorithm consisting of seven classification scenarios. Algorithm reliability was examined relative to two independent analysts' classification of a 100-bout verification sample. The algorithm was then applied to the entire set of PA bouts. RESULTS: The 706 participants' (mean age = 51 yr, 62\% female, 80\% non-Hispanic white, 70\% college graduate or higher) yielded 4702 person-days of data and had a total of 13,971 PA bouts. The algorithm showed a mean agreement of 95\% with the independent analysts. It classified PA into 8170 walking bouts (58.5 \%) and 5337 nonwalking bouts (38.2\%); 464 bouts (3.3\%) were not classified for lack of GPS and diary data. Nearly 70\% of the walking bouts and 68\% of the nonwalking bouts were classified using only the objective accelerometer and GPS data. Travel diary data helped classify 30\% of all bouts with no GPS data. The mean {$\pm$} SD duration of PA bouts classified as walking was 15.2 {$\pm$} 12.9 min. On average, participants had 1.7 walking bouts and 25.4 total walking minutes per day. CONCLUSIONS: GPS and travel diary information can be helpful in classifying most accelerometer-derived PA bouts into walking or nonwalking behavior.},

  abstract = {Background Active travel of children and adolescents is a major public health challenge, which when promoted, offers immediate health benefits and forms future sustainable travel habits. Studies show that urban form is essential for encouraging children to use non-motorized modes. Existing studies have five limitations. Firstly, they explored the relationship between urban form and the odds of active travel while neglecting the amount of active travel. Secondly, they focused on exclusively on walking. Thirdly, they were conducted in car-oriented countries. Fourthly, they did not base their analysis on detailed GIS databases. Last, they focused on 9-12 year-olds, which cannot be readily extended to older adolescents because of changes in parental attitudes. Methods We focus on the relationship between children's mobility and measurable aspects of urban form and overcome the aforementioned limitations. We explore jointly the choice and the extent of active travel of youth while distinctly considering walking and cycling, controlling for urban form measures, and taking both a ``street view'' looking at the immediate home surroundings and a ``bird's eye view'' looking at wider neighbourhoods. A Heckman selection model represents the distance covered while cycling (walking) given the mode choice being bicycle (walk) for a representative sample of 2,336 travel-activity diaries 10-15 year-old children from the Capital Region of Denmark extracted from the Danish national travel survey and combined with GIS sources and the Danish national transport model. Results Higher probability to cycle as active travel mode and longer cycling distances are related to older age of the youth and escorting by the parents, with the latter being the most dominant effect among the socioeconomic characteristics. Higher probability of cycling is positively related to: high density of low-speed roads within 1.5 km from the children's house, not having a train station with 1 km from home, low intersection density, lower car and heavy vehicle traffic densities, lower crash densities, and low share of immigrants. Conclusions Policy implications are: i) the necessity of different urban environments for walking and cycling, as the former relates to ``street view'' urban form and the latter also to ``bird's eye view''; ii) the need for measures aiming at traffic reduction and speed calming, diminution of heavy vehicle movements, lessening of cyclist-motorist conflicts at intersections, and decrease of cycling crashes, ii) the need for campaigns addressing social norms in neighbourhoods located outside the city or with higher percentages of immigrants in order to motivate active travel of children.},

Kaplan, the bestselling author of Monsoon and Balkan Ghosts, offers a revelatory new prism through which to view global upheavals and to understand what lies ahead for continents and countries around the world.Bestselling author Robert D. Kaplan builds on the insights, discoveries, and theories of great geographers and geopolitical thinkers of the recent and distant past to look back at critical pivots in history and then to look forward at the evolving global scene. Kaplan traces the history of the world's hot spots by examining their climates, topographies, and proximities to other embattled lands. He then applies the lessons learned to the present crises in Europe, Russia, China, the Indian Subcontinent, Turkey, Iran, and the Arab Middle East. The result is a holistic interpretation of the next cycle of conflict throughout Eurasia, a visionary glimpse into a future that can be understood only in the context of temperature, land allotment, and other physical certainties. A brilliant rebuttal to thinkers who suggest that globalism will trump geography, this indispensable work shows how timeless truths and natural facts can help prevent this century's looming cataclysms.Praise for The Revenge of Geography``[An] ambitious and challenging new book . . . [The Revenge of Geography] displays a formidable grasp of contemporary world politics and serves as a powerful reminder that it has been the planet's geophysical configurations, as much as the flow of competing religions and ideologies, that have shaped human conflicts, past and present.''\textemdash Malise Ruthven, The New York Review of Books``Robert D. Kaplan, the world-traveling reporter and intellectual whose fourteen books constitute a bedrock of penetrating exposition and analysis on the post-Cold War world . . . strips away much of the cant that suffuses public discourse these days on global developments and gets to a fundamental reality: that geography remains today, as it has been throughout history, one of the most powerful drivers of world events.''\textemdash The National Interest ``Kaplan plunges into a planetary review that is often thrilling in its sheer scale . . . encyclopedic.''\textemdash The New Yorker``[The Revenge of Geography] serves the facts straight up. . . . Kaplan's realism and willingness to face hard facts make The Revenge of Geography a valuable antidote to the feel-good manifestoes that often masquerade as strategic thought.''\textemdash The Daily Beast},

Research suggests that conservation behaviors may cluster into distinct dimensions, and a greater understanding of these differences could improve intervention. This article explores this idea through systematic literature review and analysis of survey data. Content analysis of 28 articles showed strong support for two primary dimensions (curtailment and efficiency), with up to nine defining attributes. However, analysis also identified inconsistencies, leaving questions about their validity. Factor analysis of survey data identified two principal components along these dimensions; subsequent analyses revealed several differences in their predictors. Results provide support for a dimensional approach and suggest further research into underlying attributes. Although the curtailment versus efficiency dichotomy may be useful, it also has the potential to obscure high leverage maintenance behaviors, especially for renters.},

  abstract = {Metropolitan planning organizations typically undertake an analysis of regional transportation plan equity to comply with federal anti-discrimination law, most prominently Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. In this critical review, we examine the law, regulatory guidance, academic research, and agency practice pertinent to equity analysis. We find that recommendations are extensive but generally lack specificity and are rarely enforceable. In the absence of detailed guidance, practice has become dominated by a single method that has foundations in the spatial analysis of environmental exposures and the neighborhood effects literature. We argue that this method is not appropriate for the analysis of transportation investment benefits, in part because target populations must be defined a priori based on demographic thresholds for areal units rather than on the basis of exposure. Further, it does not represent the travel behavior of Title VI-protected populations adequately, most notably people of color. Newer travel demand modeling paradigms are capable of sidestepping methodological problems, and legacy models can be adapted and improved. However, agencies generally have not shifted from traditional methods and planners do not view race as a variable relevant to travel behavior. By relying on an analytical technique that is not likely to reflect the travel behavior of people of color, planning agencies reduce the likelihood that racially disparate outcomes will be identified and mitigated. Meaningful transportation equity analyses must include an assessment of both current and near-term conditions and provide racially specific outcomes, while seeking to mitigate inequities through programming decisions.},

Some performance areas lend themselves well to operationalization while others do not. One area that has received comparatively little study is the assessment of a plan's impacts on environmental justice and social equity. Although research on regional planning usually emphasizes larger metropolitan areas and agencies, these issues are especially relevant in smaller regions where planners lack the capacity for innovation and careful analysis. Further, the transit services on which disadvantaged populations depend are often lacking or non-existent in less-populated regions. Understanding how planners in these locations undertake social equity-related analyses and providing suggestions for improvement is thus an important endeavor. While prior work has assessed whether, and to what extent, equity objectives are included in plans, there are few detailed investigations of the key analytical choices that shape equity outcomes. This paper fills this important research gap, providing such an analysis of existing practice in a largely rural region in California, the San Joaquin Valley, as well as recommendations for future analyses aimed at improving the consistency between equity analyses and the real-world impacts of transportation plans.},

To overcome this disadvantage, smart parking with reservation option using cloud based environment is proposed. This make the drivers easier to park the vehicles and also overcome traffic congestion. Drivers can initiate request using reservation app in the android mobile to determine the availability of the parking slot. If the slot is available a driver can reserve a slot through online payment system. The propose system also enables drivers to cancel the reserved parking slot.

  abstract = {A description is provided of changes between the 1980s and 1990s in jobs and earnings in census regions, metropolitan-nonmetropolitan areas, and central cities and suburbs in the US. The implications are discussed for mismatches between available work and local labor skills and supply, for structural unemployment, and for urban problems. By 1990 the northeast and midwest census regions had lost 1.5 million manufacturing jobs and \$37 billion in aggregate manufacturing worker earnings. 450,000 manufacturing jobs with a gain of \$19 billion in earnings were added in the south and west. The bulk of job loss was in the 28 largest metropolitan areas of the northeast and midwest (1 million jobs and over \$26 billion in manufacturing worker earnings. There were fewer jobs requiring low education levels and more information processing jobs requiring higher education, but the population in older, larger central cities remained lesser-educated minorities and immigrants. By the 1990s the jobless rate of Black males without a high school diploma was 52\% in southern cities and 63\% in midwestern cities. In poverty-ridden ghettos unemployment among younger, high school drop-outs averaged 80\%. The underground economy and the welfare economy compensated for the lack of employment among lesser-educated urban Blacks. Public policy targeted the most distressed areas for social welfare programs, but the basic issue of skills or spatial mismatch was not addressed. Policy suggestions include educational upgrading and improvement in vocational programs in the inner-cities, computerized job information networks for the entire metropolitan area, and partial subsidies for distant job searches by ghetto unemployed. The moral authority for developing behaviors that value intact families, hard work, responsibility, normative order, and that devalue self-destructive behavior must come from within communities in order for economic progress and ghetto revitalization to take place.}

  abstract = {A pedestrian network is a topological map that contains the geometric relationship between pedestrian path segments (e.g., sidewalk, crosswalk, footpath), which is needed in a variety of applications, such as pedestrian navigation services. However, current pedestrian networks are not widely available. In an effort to provide an automatic means for creating pedestrian networks, this paper presents a methodology for extracting pedestrian network from aerial and laser images. The methodology consists of data preparation and four steps: object filtering, pedestrian path region extraction, pedestrian network construction, and raster to vector conversion. An experiment, using ten images, was conducted to evaluate the performance of the methodology. Evaluation results indicate that the methodology can extract sidewalk, crosswalk, footpath, and building entrances; it collects pedestrian networks with 61 percent geometrical completeness, 67.35 percent geometrical correctness, 71 percent topological completeness and 51.38 percent topological correctness.},

  abstract = {The sharing economy, a rising pattern in consumption behavior that is based on accessing and reusing products to utilize idle capacity, presents both tremendous possibilities and significant threats for emerging as well as incumbent businesses. As of today, it is unclear whether this economy is merely another ephemeral trend in consumption or whether we are experiencing a real shift in how goods are accessed, distributed, and used. Furthermore, little is known about how existing business models are affected by the sharing economy. These two issues represent the central motivation for the development of this article. Consequently, an examination of why the sharing economy has the potential to produce a long-term transformation in consumption behavior is followed by a consideration of how this change might affect companies' business models. Based on a renowned business model framework and a variety of current illustrative examples, we propose central questions managers must ask themselves in order to be prepared to respond to changes brought about by this new economic trend.},

  abstract = {Lack of auto ownership is frequently cited as a major barrier to welfare recipients' transition to work. The importance of accessible job opportunities in employment outcomes has not, however, been empirically analyzed for welfare recipients who do not own automobiles. This study analyzes the effect of job accessibility on employment outcomes for autoless adults on welfare in Los Angeles. Two important components of this analysis are the computation of job-access measures that take into account travel modes and the incorporation of the job-access measures into multinomial logit models. The job-access measures show a considerable disparity in the number of spatially accessible job opportunities for auto users and transit users. The multinomial logit analysis indicates that for autoless welfare recipients, improving transit-based job accessibility significantly enhances the employment probability, although it does not make a significant difference in the probability of earning \$4,500 or more per year. The analysis further reveals that the job-access effect is greater for autoless welfare recipients than for auto-owning recipients. Certain policy implications suggested by the empirical findings are discussed.},

  abstract = {Many place based accessibility studies ignore the time component. Relying on theoretical frameworks that treat distance between two fixed points as constant, these methods ignore the diurnal and seasonal changes in accessibility. Network distances between two nodes are dependent on the network structure and weight distribution on the edges. These weights can change quite frequently and the network structure itself is subject to modification because of availability and unavailability of links and nodes. All these reasons point to considering the implications of volatility of accessibility of a place. Furthermore, opportunities have their own diurnal rhythms that may or may not coincide with the rhythms of the transportation networks, impacting accessibility. Using the case of transit, where all these features are readily apparent simultaneously, I demonstrate the volatility in accessibility for two counties in North Carolina. Significant diurnal changes are observed in quarter of the locations and in the rest the changes are minimal mostly because of low levels of transit accessibility. I argue not for minimizing the volatility, but for acknowledging its impacts on mode choices, location choices and therefore on spatial structure of cities.},

Methods Waist-to-height ratio and 4 cardiometabolic conditions were assessed in 3033 premenopausal midlife women (249 Hispanic, 226 Chinese, 262 Japanese, 1435 European-American, and 861 African American). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were compared across the five race/ethnic groups using waist-to-height ratio to determine the likelihood of the four cardiometabolic conditions. Results The performance of waist-to-height ratio to detect one or more cardiometabolic conditions was comparable among all race/ethnic groups (AUROC {$>$} 0.60, p = 0.252), and was good/fair (AUROC {$>$} 0.60) when hypertension, prediabetes/diabetes, dyslipidemia, or subclinical inflammation were analyzed separately. The performance of waist-to-height ratio of 0.50 was skewed towards higher specificity among groups with low prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions and lower median waist-to-height ratio, and towards higher sensitivity among groups with high prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions and higher median waist-to-height ratio. Conclusions Waist-to-height ratio can be used for community-based screening of mid-life women who may need secondary prevention for cardiometabolic conditions. A simple public health message: ``Keep your waist to less than half of your height'' applies to midlife women.},

Kisumu and Malindi, Kenya were mapped using global positioning systems, and a geographic information system was used to overlay a measured grid, which served as a sampling frame. Grid cells were stratified and randomly selected according to levels of planning and drainage. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in April and May 2001 to collect entomologic and human ecologic data. Multivariate regression analysis was used to test the relationship between the abundance of potential larval habitats, and house density, socioeconomic status, and planning and drainage. In Kisumu, 98 aquatic habitats were identified, 65\% of which were human made and 39\% were positive for anopheline larvae. In Malindi, 91 aquatic habitats were identified, of which, 93\% were human made and 65\% were harboring anopheline larvae. The regression model explains 82\% of the variance associated with the abundance of potential larval habitats in Kisumu. In Malindi, 59\% of the variance was explained. As the number of households increased, the number of larval habitats increased correspondingly to a point. Beyond a critical threshold, the density of households appeared to suppress the development of aquatic habitats. The proportion of high-income households and the planning and drainage variables tested insignificant in both locations. The integration of social and biologic sciences will allow local mosquito and malaria control groups an opportunity to assess the risk of encountering potentially infectious mosquitoes in a given area, and concentrate resources accordingly.},

Propositions of the theory of risky places are posed and then empirically tested using a GIS based program, RTMDx, on aggravated assault data in an urban area. Given the current thinking about crime vulnerability based on concentration and spatial influence of features and events, this paper offers an analytical strategy to model risky places that combines the conceptual insights of crime emergence and persistence, advances in geo-spatial analytical techniques, and micro-level data.},

  abstract = {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.},

  abstract = {Given the results from early trials, COVID-19 vaccines will be available by 2021. However, little is known about what Americans think of getting immunized with a COVID-19 vaccine. Thus, the purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic national assessment of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a community-based sample of the American adult population. A multi-item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites to recruit U.S. adults from the general population. A total of 1878 individuals participated in the study where the majority were: females (52\%), Whites (74\%), non-Hispanic (81\%), married (56\%), employed full time (68\%), and with a bachelor's degree or higher (77\%). The likelihood of getting a COVID-19 immunization in the study population was: very likely (52\%), somewhat likely (27\%), not likely (15\%), definitely not (7\%), with individuals who had lower education, income, or perceived threat of getting infected being more likely to report that they were not likely/definitely not going to get COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., vaccine hesitancy). In unadjusted group comparisons, compared to their counterparts, vaccine hesitancy was higher among African-Americans (34\%), Hispanics (29\%), those who had children at home (25\%), rural dwellers (29\%), people in the northeastern U.S. (25\%), and those who identified as Republicans (29\%). In multiple regression analyses, vaccine hesitancy was predicted significantly by sex, education, employment, income, having children at home, political affiliation, and the perceived threat of getting infected with COVID-19 in the next 1~year. Given the high prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, evidence-based communication, mass media strategies, and policy measures will have to be implemented across the U.S. to convert vaccines into vaccinations and mass immunization with special attention to the groups identified in this study.},

Short trips are defined as those within the 95th percentile walking distance in the data, here 1.40 miles (2.25 km). The mean walking distance was 0.4 miles (0.6 km). The mode distribution was automobile (75\%), walk (23\%), bicycle (1\%), and bus (1\%). Walk and bicycle are found less likely as the individual's age increases. People are more likely to drive if they can or are accustomed to. People in multi-person families are less likely to walk or use bus, especially families with children. An environment that attracts people's interest and provides activity opportunities encourages people to walk on short trips. Influencing people's choice of transport mode on short trips should be an important part of efforts encouraging the use of non-automobile alternatives.},

We develop a local preference hypothesis based on the delegated philanthropy and transaction-costs theories. Consistent with the hypothesis, local institutional ownership is negatively related to facility toxic release. The negative relation is stronger for local socially responsible investing (SRI) funds, local public pension funds, and local dedicated institutions. We also find that the relation is more negative in communities that prefer more stringent environmental policies and in communities of greater collective cohesiveness. Local institutional ownership, particularly local ownerships by SRI funds and public pension funds, is positively related to the probability that an ESG proposal is either introduced or withdrawn. The paper sheds light on the drivers behind institutions' ESG engagement and their effectiveness in influencing ESG.This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.},

To understand the emerging pattern of racial inequality in the effects of COVID-19, we examined the relative burden of social vulnerability and health risk factors. We found significant spatial clusters of social vulnerability and risk factors, both of which are significantly associated with the increased COVID19-related death rate. We also found that a higher percentage of African Americans was associated with increased levels of social vulnerability and risk factors. In addition, the proportion of African American residents has an independent effect on the COVID-19 death rate. We argue that existing inequity is often highlighted in emergency conditions. The disproportionate effects of COVID-19 in African American communities are a reflection of racial inequality and social exclusion that existed before the COVID-19 crisis.},

Sleek, legible mobility platforms are connecting people to cars, trains, buses, and bikes as never before, opening up a range of new transportation options while improving existing ones. While many large city governments, such as Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C., have begun to embrace creative forms and processes of government, most still operate under the weight of an unwieldy, risk-averse bureaucracy.With the advent of self-driving vehicles and other technological shifts upon us, Gabe Klein asks how we can close the gap between the energized, aggressive world of start-ups and the complex bureaucracies struggling to change beyond a geologic time scale. From his experience as a food-truck entrepreneur to a ZipCar executive and a city transportation commissioner, Klein's career has focused on bridging the public-private divide, finding and celebrating shared goals, and forging better cities with more nimble, consumer-oriented bureaucracies.In Start-Up City, Klein, with David Vega-Barachowitz, demonstrates how to affect big, directional change in cities\textemdash and how to do it fast. Klein's objective is to inspire what he calls ``public entrepreneurship,'' a start-up-pace energy within the public sector, brought about by leveraging the immense resources at its disposal.~ Klein offers guidance for cutting through the morass, and a roadmap for getting real, meaningful projects done quickly and having fun while doing it.This book is for anyone who wants to change the way we live in cities without waiting for the glacial pace of change in government.},

  abstract = {On Thursday, July 13, 1995, Chicagoans awoke to a blistering day in which the temperature would reach 106 degrees. The heat index, which measures how the temperature actually feels on the body, would hit 126 degrees by the time the day was over. Meteorologists had been warning residents about a two-day heat wave, but these temperatures did not end that soon. When the heat wave broke a week later, city streets had buckled; the records for electrical use were shattered; and power grids had failed, leaving residents without electricity for up to two days. And by July 20, over seven hundred people had perished-more than twice the number that died in the Chicago Fire of 1871, twenty times the number of those struck by Hurricane Andrew in 1992\textemdash in the great Chicago heat wave, one of the deadliest in American history.  Heat waves in the United States kill more people during a typical year than all other natural disasters combined. Until now, no one could explain either the overwhelming number or the heartbreaking manner of the deaths resulting from the 1995 Chicago heat wave. Meteorologists and medical scientists have been unable to account for the scale of the trauma, and political officials have puzzled over the sources of the city's vulnerability. In Heat Wave, Eric Klinenberg takes us inside the anatomy of the metropolis to conduct what he calls a "social autopsy," examining the social, political, and institutional organs of the city that made this urban disaster so much worse than it ought to have been.  Starting with the question of why so many people died at home alone, Klinenberg investigates why some neighborhoods experienced greater mortality than others, how the city government responded to the crisis, and how journalists, scientists, and public officials reported on and explained these events. Through a combination of years of fieldwork, extensive interviews, and archival research, Klinenberg uncovers how a number of surprising and unsettling forms of social breakdown\textemdash including the literal and social isolation of seniors, the institutional abandonment of poor neighborhoods, and the retrenchment of public assistance programs\textemdash contributed to the high fatality rates. The human catastrophe, he argues, cannot simply be blamed on the failures of any particular individuals or organizations. For when hundreds of people die behind locked doors and sealed windows, out of contact with friends, family, community groups, and public agencies, everyone is implicated in their demise.  As Klinenberg demonstrates in this incisive and gripping account of the contemporary urban condition, the widening cracks in the social foundations of American cities that the 1995 Chicago heat wave made visible have by no means subsided as the temperatures returned to normal. The forces that affected Chicago so disastrously remain in play in America's cities, and we ignore them at our peril.  For the Second Edition Klinenberg has added a new Preface showing how climate change has made extreme weather events in urban centers a major challenge for cities and nations across our planet, one that will require commitment to climate-proofing changes to infrastructure rather than just relief responses.},

Following the recent contribution to the discussion of sense of place, authenticity and character by Jiv\'en \& Larkham (Journal of Urban Design, vol. 8, 2003, pp. 67\textendash 81), it is suggested that architects, planners and urban designers should be attentive to the theoretical underpinnings that are relevant to place-making. The emphasis here is on the relationships between the pace of life and the capacity of urban settings to facilitate the routine encounters and shared experiences that underpin the intersubjectivity that, in turn, leads to the social construction of place. These issues are placed in the context of the `fast world' of globalization and of grass-roots reaction to its consequences, as illustrated by the Slow City movement.},

  abstract = {Existing research on nineteenth-century cycling focuses more on its role in shaping modern tourism than on its urban origins. In this paper, in contrast, we analyse the emergence of cycling in four of Belgium's leading industrial and commercial cities: Brussels, Antwerp, Li\`ege and Ghent. From the 1860s onwards, a `golden age' of urban planning created new sites of bourgeois power and display in these urban centres. Simultaneously, the new, adventurous sport of cycling was picked up by the younger members of this bourgeoisie. Their increasing presence in the newly constructed urban streets and parks, however, was fraught with conflict. Dealing with a negative public image, problematic interactions with other road users and limiting traffic regulations, cyclists constantly had to legitimise their urban presence. Especially in the 1890s, cycling clubs and umbrella associations attempted to discipline cyclists and to foster the image of urban cycling as an orderly, socially respectable form of leisure. This, together with cycling's growing popularity and increasing leverage with city councils over questions of road maintenance and traffic regulation, resulted in cyclists becoming more influential in (re)shaping urban space. Starting in 1895, however, the automobile started taking the bicycle's place as a new, dominant form of urban mobility.},

Discharge information, however, does not necessarily capture potential health effects. We propose an alternative environmental performance measure that includes the public health risks of toxic air emissions extended to industry supply chains using economic input-output life-cycle assessment. Cancer risk to the U.S. population was determined by applying a damage function to the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) as modeled by CalTOX, a multimedia multi-pathway fate and exposure model. Risks were then translated into social costs using cancer willingness to pay. For a baseline emissions year of 1998, 260 excess cancer cases were calculated for 116 TRI chemicals, dominated by ingestion risk from polycyclic aromatic compounds and dioxins emitted by the primary aluminum and cement industries, respectively. The direct emissions of a small number of industry sectors account for most of the U.S. population cancer risk. For the majority of industry sectors, however, cancer risk per \$1 million output is associated with supply chain upstream emissions. Ranking industries by total (direct + upstream) supply chain risk per economic output leads to different conclusions about the relative hazards associated with these industries than a conventional ranking based on emissions per economic output.},

It is suggested that this theoretical framework now allows a better appraisal of accessibility indicators and precise recommendations are proposed for their practical formulation and use. Various examples are given, especially for disaggregate analysis where a calculation ``for a given person'' is proposed instead of the conventional calculation .``by a given mode''. Finally, the relations between accessibility and trip rate are examined; from a study made in French cities, it is suggested that accessibility is a powerful determinant of trip rate.},

Results indicated a significant linear trend, such that messages highlighting more prevalent descriptive social norms increased sustainable transportation behavior (relative to private vehicle use) for commuting, but not non-commuting, purposes. Participants in the high social norm condition decreased their commuting-related private vehicle use by approximately five times, compared with baseline. Car-use message campaigns can reduce private vehicle use by highlighting descriptive norms about others' sustainable transportation efforts, but these messages appear to be most effective for commuting behavior.},

It is a daily hurdle that affects millions of people, but existing approaches fail to solve this conundrum. Thus, there is an urgent demand for reputable, motivated, and replicable solutions that can be used by cities of any size. We are proposing an experiment to analyse the interplay between incentive mechanisms, user participation, and the truthfulness of reports. For that, we are developing the ``wePark application'' based on concepts of crowd sourcing and social regulation. As a differential, we are examining alternative methods to motivate adoption, such as reciprocity, reputation, altruism, and money. In this paper, we analyse the requirements of the solution, propose a development test bed, and an experimental environment for this study.},

Most former drivers obtained rides from relatives and friends. Use of public transportation was low, and some seniors were not aware of available public transportation services. Older drivers did not plan for driving cessation. Over half the drivers who perceived a likelihood of driving problems within 5 years expected to keep driving beyond 5 years. Impact on industry: Because of their lifelong reliance on the automobile, their desire to drive themselves, and their lack of experience with public transportation, efforts to enhance the mobility of older people should consider this background while alternatives to the personal automobile are developed.},

  abstract = {An investigation into the policy effects of requiring firms to disclose information about their environmental performance. Coming Clean is the first book to investigate the process of information disclosure as a policy strategy for environmental protection. This process, which requires that firms disclose information about their environmental performance, is part of an approach to environmental protection that eschews the conventional command-and-control regulatory apparatus, which sometimes leads government and industry to focus on meeting only minimal standards. The authors of Coming Clean examine the effectiveness of information disclosure in achieving actual improvements in corporate environmental performance by analyzing data from the federal government's Toxics Release Inventory, or TRI, and drawing on an original set of survey data from corporations and federal, state, and local officials, among other sources. The authors find that TRI--probably the best-known example of information disclosure--has had a substantial effect over time on the environmental performance of industry. But, drawing on case studies from across the nation, they show that the improvement is not uniform: some facilities have been leaders while others have been laggards. The authors argue that information disclosure has an important role to play in environmental policy--but only as part of an integrated set of policy tools that includes conventional regulation. nformation disclosure--has had a substantial effect over time on the environmental performance of industry.

Utilizing a systematic review of the health and social science literature, the authors consider the segregation-health association through the lens of 4 questions of interest to epidemiologists: How is segregation best measured? Is the segregation-health association socially or biologically plausible? What evidence is there of segregation-health associations? Is segregation a modifiable risk factor? Thirty-nine identified studies test an association between segregation and health outcomes. The health effects of segregation are relatively consistent, but complex. Isolation segregation is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes and increased mortality for blacks, but several studies report health-protective effects of living in clustered black neighborhoods net of social and economic isolation. The majority of reviewed studies are cross-sectional and use coarse measures of segregation. Future work should extend recent developments in measuring and conceptualizing segregation in a multilevel framework, build upon the findings and challenges in the neighborhood-effects literature, and utilize longitudinal data sources to illuminate opportunities for public health action to reduce racial disparities in disease.},

  abstract = {Context The Global Positioning System (GPS) represents an innovative way to objectively assess the spatial locations of physical activity behavior. Purpose The aim of this systematic review was to determine the capability of GPS to collect high quality data on the location of activities in research on the relationship between physical activity and the environment. Evidence acquisition Published and unpublished articles identified from seven electronic databases, reference lists, bibliographies and websites up to March 2010 were systematically searched for, appraised and analysed in summer 2010. Included studies used GPS to measure the spatial locations of physical activity and some form of environmental analysis related to the GPS data. The capability of GPS was expressed in terms of data quality which in turn was defined as the proportion of GPS data lost in each study. Evidence synthesis 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Data loss was positively correlated with the measurement period for which participants were asked to wear the GPS device (r=0.81, p{$<$}0.001). Major reasons for data loss included signal drop outs, loss of device battery power, and poor adherence of participants to measurement protocols. Data loss did not differ significantly between children and adults or by study sample size, year of publication or GPS device manufacturer. Conclusions GPS is a promising tool for improving our understanding of the spatial context of physical activity. Our findings suggest that the choice of an appropriate device and efforts to maximise participant adherence are key improving data quality, especially over longer study periods.},

Today, public health departments can employ multiple strategies to improve housing, such as developing and enforcing housing guidelines and codes, implementing ``Healthy Homes'' programs to improve indoor environmental quality, assessing housing conditions, and advocating for healthy, affordable housing.

Point estimates for rate ratios were consistently greatest for the novel ICE that jointly measured extreme concentrations of income and race/ethnicity. For example, the census tract\textendash level rate ratio for infant mortality comparing the bottom versus top quintile for an ICE contrasting low-income Black versus high-income White equaled 2.93 (95\% confidence interval [CI]\,=\,2.11, 4.09), but was 2.19 (95\% CI\,=\,1.59, 3.02) for low versus high income, 2.77 (95\% CI\,=\,2.02, 3.81) for Black versus White, and 1.56 (95\% CI\,=\,1.19, 2.04) for census tracts with greater than or equal to 30\% versus less than 10\% below poverty.Conclusions. The ICE may be a useful metric for public health monitoring, as it simultaneously captures extremes of privilege and deprivation and can jointly measure economic and racial/ethnic segregation.},

  abstract = {A growing number of scientific studies in recent years have investigated disparate exposure to ecological hazards in American society. Working from an environmental justice perspective, this body of research consistently reveals that poor communities of color are most likely to bear a disproportionate burden of negative externalities. These studies utilize a wide range of research methodologies, including various indicators of ecological hazards (e.g., proximity to waste sites, industrial emissions, ambient air quality), but few, if any, utilize composite measures to approximate cumulative environmental impact. Consequently, the environmental justice (EJ) literature is characterized by a failure to effectively measure overall impact from an extensive range of ecological hazards. Limitations on available data make this a serious problem for present and future studies. We argue that cumulative measures of environmental impact can play an important role in furthering our understanding of environmental injustices in the United States. In this study of Massachusetts, we develop and implement such a cumulative measure of negative environmental impacts. By controlling for the density and severity of ecological hazardous sites and facilities within every community in the state, we demonstrate that exposure patterns take a generally linear distribution when analyzed by race and class. So, while our results reaffirm previous findings that low-income communities and communities of color bear significantly greater ecological burdens than predominantly White and more affluent communities, our findings also suggest that environmental injustices exist on a remarkably consistent continuum for nearly all communities. In other words, as the minority population and lower-income composition of a community increases, correspondingly, so does cumulative exposure to environmental hazards. In this respect, communities which are more racially mixed and of moderate income status that are not typically identified as meeting EJ criteria (in demographic terms) also face more significant ecological hazards. Thus, the strict bifurcation of communities into categories of Environmental Justice and Non-Environmental Justice is problematic, and poses a serious dilemma for policy makers, public health officials, and community activists. To overcome this challenge requires the adoption of a cumulative environmental justice impact assessment (CEJIA), which in addition to the demographic characteristics of a community, also takes into account the total environmental burden and related health impacts upon residents. Furthermore, through the adoption of the precautionary principle, source reduction, and alternative forms of ``cleaner'' production, environmental justice advocates must work for policies which reduce the environmental threat for the full range of communities, as well as their own.

The aim of the policy is that no one should be killed or seriously injured due to traffic accidents and that the design of the road transport system should be adapted to those requirements. Vision Zero has been described as a policy innovation with a focus on the tolerance of the human body to kinetic energy and that the responsibility for road safety falls on the system designers. In Sweden, the Vision Zero terminology has spread to other safety-related areas, such as fire safety, patient safety, workplace safety and suicide. The purpose of this article is to analyze, through a comparative content analysis, each Vision Zero policy by identifying the policy decision, policy problem, policy goal, and policy measures. How a policy is designed and formulated has a direct effect on implementation and outcome. The similarities and differences between the policies give an indication of the transfer method in each case. The results show that the Vision Zero policies following the Vision Zero for road traffic contain more than merely a similar terminology, but also that the ideas incorporated in Vision Zero are not grounded within each policy area as one would expect. The study shows that it is easier to imitate formulations in a seemingly successful policy and harder to transform Vision Zero into a workable tool in each policy area.},

This has led them to link industrial processes at various spatial scales and to revisit well-defined organizational structures, especially city systems. Taking stock of renewed interest, this paper investigates the relationship between urban regional systems and industrial market structure. The paper demonstrates that the U.S. is composed of urban regional systems that vary in density of urban settlement, and argues that dynamic externalities and barriers to market entry and exit play out within these distinct systems to develop regionalized industry market structures that range from competitive to oligopolistic. An empirical analysis identifies these market structures through use of a Hildreth-Houck variable-coefficients model. Elasticity-of-scale estimates are derived for thirteen consumer and producer services industries at the MSA scale, using 1982 and 1992 County Business Patterns data. The results reveal a systematic geography of industry structure generally supportive of the hypotheses linking density of urban settlement to industry market structure. Producer services industries in the western U.S. tend toward oligopolistic market structures, while those in the more densely settled midwest and east are more competitive.},

  publisher = {{Helsinki University of Technology}},
  abstract = {According to James J. Gibson, the concept of the affordance refers to the functionally significant properties of the environment, and provides a psychologically relevant means to analyze evolving child-environment relationships. Affordances operationalize the transactional approach. Thus the concept allows researchers to bring the material environment back into the realm of environmental psychology. The framework of ecological perceptual psychology, and in particular the concept of the affordance, was utilized in determining the criteria for child-friendly environments. An assessment model for a child-friendly environment was constructed, which comprises two central criteria for environmental child friendliness: children's possibilities for independent mobility and their opportunities to actualize affordances. By combining various degrees of these two criteria, four hypothetical types of environment were distinguished, Bullerby, Wasteland, Cell, and Glasshouse. The Bullerby type represents a child-friendly environment, as it allows a positive interactive cycle to develop between a child and the environment. In the Bullerby type sufficient possibilities for independent mobility enables to a child to discover environmental affordances. Actualized affordances for their part motivate the child to move around more in the environment, which creates more possibilities for new affordances to become actualized. The empirical results from the study of eight- and nine-year-old children indicated that the developed model was sensitive enough to assess the child friendliness of different communities in Finland and Belarus (Belorussia). All hypothesized environmental types appeared in the data. Each neighborhood had a unique combination of affordances and independent mobility in terms of the model. The Bullerby type of setting abounded in the Finnish communities. The Cell, Wasteland, and Glasshouse types of environment were the most common in the Belorussian data. In general, the proportion of Bullerby-type settings decreased and that of Glasshouse-type settings increased as the degree of urbanization rose. The two-dimensional assessment model presented here could be further developed so that it includes a third dimension such as, for example, the emotional value of affordances for children. At the same time an essential future challenge for ecological perceptual psychology, that of studying the motivational basis of affordances, could be met. As the transactional approach of environmental psychology allows for the integration of children's experiences with the material world, it provides information that can be used in the design and planning of child-friendly environments.},

North America's first e-bikesharing system (cycleUshare) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, offers a new, sustainable transportation option for students, faculty, and staff. The cycleUshare system with two stations was launched as a small pilot project to study the technology and its users' experiences. This paper presents an overview of the cycleUshare system and reports experiences from the first year of operation. With 93 enrolled users, cycleUshare provided a unique opportunity to study not only the system's use but how individual users made trips with both regular bicycles and e-bikes and the factors that influenced those trips. The study reported here found that only 22\% of users accounted for 81\% of the trips. Factors of speed and convenience played major roles in participants' decisions to use the system, and speed and comfort were the most influential factors in the selection of an e-bike rather than a regular bicycle. Most of the reported trips were class related, although e-bikes were used for a wide variety of trip purposes. Walking was the mode most displaced by the system; this result indicated that e-bikesharing expanded user mobility. User perceptions about bicycle types were explored also. This model of e-bikeshare was effective in its capability to attract users to both regular bicycles and e-bikes and to expand user mobility.},

However, the literature on DEA pays little attention to the spatial aspects of transit systems. This study combines DEA and geographic information systems (GIS) to evaluate the performance of bus lines within a public transit system, considering both the operations and operational environment. First, we use GIS to create demographic profiles within the service corridor of each bus line. Then, we apply the DEA method to compute each bus line's operational efficiency and spatial effectiveness scores. This approach allows for close inspection and comparison of operational and spatial aspects of bus lines. We suggest ways to improve the performance of bus lines based on the characteristics of the two types of scores.},

A trip to Detroit in March 2014 brought UCLA Urban Planning and Policy students face to face with the challenging environment Detroit citizens cope with. While the mostly low-income population that remains in Detroit requires ad- equate public transportation for job access and basic mobility, transit competes with all city services for extremely scarce resources. Furthermore, the city's mismanagement, coupled with a lack of regional integration, has catalyzed the deterioration of transit provisions. In addition to funding and management problems, Detroit area transit has two disjointed and dysfunctional systems, one for the city (DDOT) and one for the suburbs (SMART). Meaning- fully improving the transit access of city residents will require a true regional transit opera- tor, in turn requiring that Detroit and its suburbs learn to live and work together. Reflecting on our weeklong exploration of city neighborhoods, we evaluate the poor coordination be- tween transit agencies in the Detroit region, and use census data and a city-to-suburb com- muting example to illustrate the barriers transit users face in the current system.},

Using qualitative content analysis, we examine 801 posts on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Facebook page to highlight the interplay between risk, the social construction of Zika and trust in experts. Three themes are discussed, including Zika: (i) as legitimate public health threat; (ii) as product of CDC corruption and (iii) used to question medical expertise. We find the latter two themes supportive of Gidden's focus on risk and distrust in expert authority and discuss the danger of constructing EIDs as products of corrupt expert authority on public health social media platforms.},

Originally seen as universal, and therefore outside space and place, studies in science, technology, and society (STS) located it first in specific locations -- laboratories -- and then in narrow networks linking laboratories. This double location implied that science is caught up in and enacts two topological forms -- region and network -- since objects in networks hold their shape by freezing relations rather than fixing Euclidean coordinates. More recent STS work suggests that science and technology also exist in and help to enact additional spatial forms. Thus some technoscience objects are fluid, holding their form by shifting their relations. And yet others achieve constancy by enacting simultaneous absence and presence, a topological possibility which we call here fire . The paper concludes by arguing that the 'global' includes and is enacted in all four of these topological systems.},

Its beneficial impacts result from food production and industrial application. The detrimental impacts occur because most of the Nr used in food production and the entire amount of Nr formed during fossil fuel combustion are lost to the environment where it causes a cascade of environmental changes that negatively impact both people and ecosystems. We developed a tool called N-Calculator, a nitrogen footprint model that provides information on how individual and collective action can result in the loss of Nr to the environment. The N-Calculator focuses on food and energy consumption, using average per capita data for a country. When an individual uses the N-Calculator, the country average is scaled based on the individual's answers to questions about resource consumption. N footprints were calculated for the United States and the Netherlands, which were found to be 41 kg N/capita/yr and 24 kg N/capita/yr, respectively. For both countries, the food portion of the footprint is the largest, and the food production N footprints are greater than the food consumption N footprints. The overarching message from the N-Calculator is that our lifestyle choices, and especially our food consumption, have major impacts on the Nr losses to the environment. Communicating this message to all of the stakeholders (the public, policymakers, and governments) through tools like the N-Calculator will help reduce Nr losses to the environment.},

The need for parameterization of the bivariate spatial dependence is precipitated by the realization that aspatial bivariate association measures, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient, do not recognize spatial distributional aspects of data sets. This study devises an L statistic by integrating Pearson's r as an aspatial bivariate association measure and Moran's I as a univariate spatial association measure.

Studies of these processes were mostly done with verbal description until H\"agerstrand (1966) started to approach it with quantitative models. A variety of attempts were made to continue this effort, but only with various degrees of success. Recognizing the critical role that distances between geographic objects or events play in a spatial diffusion process, we experimented with a new approach that uses these distances to detect and distinguish different types of spatial diffusion processes. Our approach is a two-step process that first calculates nearest neighbor ratios in a point process at each time step and then applies regression curve estimation to observe how these ratios change over time. We first report the results from applying this method to three spatio-temporal data sets which show the feasibility of our approach. We then report results of randomly simulated spatial diffusion processes to see if our approach is effective for the purpose of distinguishing different types of spatial diffusion processes. With only extreme cases as exceptions, our experiment found that using estimated regression curves of nearest neighbor ratios over time is usable in classifying spatial diffusion processes to either contagious/expansion or hierarchical/relocation diffusion processes.},

Two major findings arise out of a case study. First, we observe a mismatch between the nature of information and the main addressees of the disclosed information, which led the operation of the subject disclosure program to deviate from its targets. Second, this institutional deficiency has to do with the organizational culture and routine practice of the implementing agency. The second finding challenges a major justification of information-based environmental regulation ( IBER) administered in weak states and underscores the role that administrative capacity plays in making novel regulations come into effect. Contrary to the popular belief that IBER creates non-governmental forces that offset a limited statehood, it may be less likely to work where state administrative capacity is weak.},

Currently, there is a limited understanding of the ways in which transportation and QOL intersect, and little is known about how metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in the United States are addressing QOL outcomes. This study addressed these gaps by developing a conceptual framework holistically linking transportation to QOL. The proposed framework identified four transportation-related QOL dimensions\textemdash physical, mental, social, and economic well-being\textemdash which are predominantly influenced by three components of the transportation system: mobility/accessibility, the built environment, and vehicle traffic. This framework then formed the basis for a content analysis of 148 long-range transportation plans in the United States to evaluate the extent to which QOL is being considered in the planning process. The results of the analysis and a follow-up examination of 13 plans revealed that MPOs are inconsistently addressing QOL. Plans primarily targeted QOL enhancement from the perspective of physical well-being, while mental and social well-being were rarely considered. Policy recommendations were provided to more comprehensively integrate QOL into the transportation planning process.},

  abstract = {Active transportation modes are increasingly being acknowledged for their individual and societal benefits. As a result, funding for pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure in the United States has increased substantially in recent years. However, pedestrian and bicycle equity impacts often go overlooked, which has resulted in an inequitable distribution of active transportation costs and benefits. The paper contributes to this small but growing field by developing an enhanced understanding of active transportation equity, identifying limitations in research and in practice, and providing a set of recommendations for planners and researchers. These recommendations include considering other transportation-disadvantaged groups beyond low-income and minority populations in equity analysis, adopting new performance measures, increasing inter-agency coordination, the need for stronger guidance from the federal government, and more representation from transportation-disadvantaged groups in the public participation and decision-making process. If the costs and benefits of active transportation are to be fairly shared among all users, equity will need to be meaningfully addressed in the planning process.},

While there has been a considerable literature addressing consumption and waste reduction from different disciplinary perspectives, the complex nature of the problem requires an increasing degree of interdisciplinarity. Resource recovery and the optimisation of material flow can only be achieved alongside and through behaviour change to reduce the creation of material waste and wasteful consumption.

Findings from our inquiry lead us to focus more closely on the administrative functions of the state, especially its role as a regulatory body. A case study focusing on health risks from incompatible land uses illustrates how spatial inequities result from the formally neutral rule-making actions of regulatory agencies and their particular organizational cultures. We describe the ethical basis of the regulatory state in terms of its formal, juridical, deontological underpinnings. In contrast to this stands the alternative ethical concept of care, which is inherently relational, contextual, and preferentially attentive to the needs of the vulnerable. We argue that the regulatory state can be reformed, building structures of care to better address issues of spatial inequity. We end with a discussion of how the institutional model of the caring state might be achieved in practice.},

  abstract = {The extensive literature on environmental justice has, by now, well defined the essential ingredients of cumulative risk, namely, incompatible land uses and vulnerability. Most problematic is the case when risk is produced by a large aggregation of small sources of air toxics. In this article, we test these notions in an area of Southern California, Southeast Los Angeles (SELA), which has come to be known as Asthmatown. Developing a rapid risk mapping protocol, we scan the neighborhood for small potential sources of air toxics and find, literally, hundreds of small point sources within a 2-mile radius, interspersed with residences. We also map the estimated cancer risks and noncancer hazard indices across the landscape. We find that, indeed, such large aggregations of even small, nondominant sources of air toxics can produce markedly elevated levels of risk. In this study, the risk profiles show additional cancer risks of up to 800 in a million and noncancer hazard indices of up to 200 in SELA due to the agglomeration of small point sources. This is significant (for example, estimates of the average regional point-source-related cancer risk range from 125 to 200 in a million). Most importantly, if we were to talk about the risk contour as if they were geological structures, we would observe not only a handful of distinct peaks, but a general ``mountain range'' running all throughout the study area, which underscores the ubiquity of risk in SELA. Just as cumulative risk has deeply embedded itself into the fabric of the place, so, too, must intervention seek to embed strategies into the institutions and practices of SELA. This has implications for advocacy, as seen in a recently initiated participatory action research project aimed at building health research capacities into the community in keeping with an ethic of care.},

The author inquires into GIS as a technology for incorporating knowledge into institutional use and includes five propositions: (1) GIS's efficiencies in data processing allows it unprecedented facility and scope of analysis, (2) its use increases alienation, (3) its mimetic language furthers its role in planning, (4) its logic appears rational\textemdash purposive, but it conceals an underlying normative logic, and (5) its most profound effect is on the mapper, and the alienating and normative character of GIS necessitate new modes of ``social ground-truthing.'' The author studies the southeast Los Angeles (SELA) initiatives to demonstrate these propositions. This article compares two studies: one GIS-based, and the other based on participatory action research and discusses how GIS might be recontextualized into a technology for liberating democratizing processes.},

On 8 November 2013, Typhoon Haiyan struck the province of Leyte, Philippines, with casualties numbering in the thousands, largely because of the ensuing storm surge that swept the coastal communities. This study investigates the role and dynamics of risk communication in these events, specifically examining the organizational processing of text within a complex institutional milieu. The authors show how the risk communication process failed to convey meaningful information about the predicted storm surge, transmitting and retransmitting the same routine text instead of communicating authentic messages in earnest. The key insight is that, rather than focus solely on the verbatim transmission of a scripted text, risk communication needs to employ various modes of translation and feedback signals across organizational and institutional boundaries. Adaptation will require overcoming organizational rigidities in order to craft proportionate responses to extreme weather events that may lie outside personal and institutional memory. Future work should build upon the textual processing approach to risk communication, expanding it into a comprehensive relational model of environmental cognition.},

  abstract = {There is growing evidence that the frequency and magnitude of extreme weather events may be increasing in conjunction with climate change. This means that many communities will encounter phenomena, such as extreme storm surge events, never before experienced by local residents. The tragic effects of Typhoon Haiyan on the city of Tacloban, Philippines, in November 2013 were attributed, in part, to the inability of routine technical bulletins to communicate the unprecedented nature of the predicted storm surge. In response, the authors construct a relational model of risk communication that suggests that narrative messages that simulate direct face-to-face communication may be more effective in spurring action. Conducting a postevent target audience study in the city of Tacloban, the authors tested the relative effectiveness of narrative-based versus technical message designs on residents who chose not to evacuate during the typhoon. Results show increased effectiveness of the narrative design vis-\`a-vis intent to evacuate, self-relevance and vividness of the message, and perceived authority of the message source. The study also explored factors behind noncompliance with evacuation advisories. The research supports the relational model, which captures insights from recent research on evacuation and emergency preparedness for extreme hazard events. It supports a broader effort to democratize risk communication and, in so doing, increase people's sense of agency in preparing for these events.},

DESIGN .\hspace{0.6em} Cross-sectional survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS.\hspace{0.6em} All residents registered at the University of Toronto were surveyed after the 1999\textendash 2000 influenza season. Of the 1,159 questionnaires mailed, 670 (58\%) could be evaluated. RESULTS.\hspace{0.6em} Influenza-like illnesses were reported by 36\% of house staff. The vaccination rate was 51\% among respondents, being highest for community and occupational medicine and pediatric staff (77\% and 75\%) and lowest for psychiatry, surgery, and radiology staff (32\%, 36\%, and 36\%). Vaccinees reported significantly fewer episodes of illness (42 vs 54 per 100 subjects; P = .03) and fewer days of illness (272 vs 374 per 100 subjects; P = .02); absenteeism was not different (63 vs 69 per 100 subjects; P = .69). Self-protection was the most common reason for vaccination. Vaccinees believed the vaccine was more effective than did non-vaccinees (P {$<$} .01). Non-vaccinees considered influenza-like symptoms the most important side effect of the vaccine. Busy schedules and inconvenience were the most common reasons for not getting vaccinated. Overall, 44\% of house staff believed the influenza vaccine should be mandatory. CONCLUSIONS.\hspace{0.6em} Influenza-like illness was common among house staff. They tended to work through their illnesses, potentially putting patients at risk. They were motivated mostly by self-protection and did report a benefit. Despite busy schedules and an unfounded fear of getting influenza symptoms from the vaccine, many thought the vaccine should be mandatory.},

World p have redrawn its boundaries numerous times. Since the establishment of the state of Israel in 1 948 within British Mandate Palestine, Palestinians and Israelis have disagreed over the national identity of the land that they both inhabitThe struggles have extended from the battlefields to the classrooms. In the process, different national and ethnic groups have used various sciences, ranging from archeology to history and geography, to prove territorial claims based on their historical presence in the region. But how have various Israeli social and political groups used maps to solidify claims over the territory? In this paper we bring together science studies and critical cartography in order to investigate cartographic representations as socially embedded practices and address how visual rhetoric intersects with knowledge claims in cartography. Before the 1 967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the Israeli government and the Jewish National Fund produced maps of Israel that established a Hebrew topography of the land. After 1 967 Israel's expanded territorial control made the demarcation of its borders ever more controversial. Consequently, various Israeli interest groups and political parties increasingly used various cartographic techniques to forge territorial spaces, demarcate disputed boundaries, and inscribe particular national, political, and ethnic identities onto the land.},

Data were collected from a probability sample of 509 information workers in Hong Kong who were not self-employed. The results showed that the more that people used ICT to do their work at home, the greater they perceived their work/family borders flexible and permeable. Interestingly, low flexibility and high permeability, rather than the use of ICT at home, had much stronger influences on increasing, in particular, family-to-work conflict. As expected, work-to-family conflict was significantly and positively associated with technostress. Results also showed that the telecommuters tended to be older, had lower family incomes, used ICT frequently at home, and had a permeable boundary that allowed work to penetrate their home domain. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {There are nearly two million subscribers to carsharing services worldwide. These services can provide large benefits both to users and the general public (e.g., through emissions reductions). There has not however previously existed a general framework for forecasting their market potential and impacts that is sensitive to the way that they re-structure the costs associated with personal car ownership. Techniques for predicting market scope and impacts ahead of field implementation are urgently required, both by entrepreneurs and the public sector, whose support, or at least acquiescence, is generally required. This paper draws on the Perceived Activity Set conceptual framework that was recently developed to address the methodological challenges posed by carsharing, and presents the first set of empirical findings from employing it to model carsharing. The empirical analysis makes uses of pooled data from the British National Travel Survey and a purpose-designed stated-choice survey. We investigate both the `round-trip' and `point-to-point' carsharing service models. The results suggest that the number of prospective subscribers to a point-to-point carsharing service in London is between three and four times as large as the comparable number for round-trip carsharing. The greatest reduction in overall vehicle-miles of travel \textendash{} including both carsharing cars and private cars \textendash{} was found from introducing round-trip carsharing across all of London. Survey respondents indicated they would use point-to-point carsharing for commuting journeys much more frequently than round-trip carsharing. Finally, point-to-point carsharing was found to be a substitute for public transport, whilst round-trip carsharing was found to be a complement.},

  abstract = {The notion of spatio-temporal accessibility to [potential] out-of-home activities is central to transport geography. This paper extends existing theory by proposing a new concept of accessibility, termed the `perceived activity set' (PAS). A person's PAS is defined as the set of out-of-home activities which they view as encompassing their potential travel needs when making decisions that structurally affect their accessibility. In other words, it is proposed that a person's mobility-linked choices such as, for instance, where to live or whether to own a car, are a function of how such choices affect their ability to access out-of-home activities they consider relevant. This paper first formalises the PAS and places it in the wider context of accessibility theory. It then presents an empirical study that makes use of the PAS concept, which analyses people's ownership of several mobility resources that each enable particular forms of travel. The PAS appears promising, as it unlocks a class of flexible techniques that relax restrictive assumptions regarding the drivers behind structural choices related to personal mobility. The techniques were found to be analytically tractable, and the empirical analysis based on the PAS yielded a number of insights. The advantages of using long-duration diaries with PAS-based techniques, rather than more-common one-day diaries, are shown to be large. It was found that the more `substantial' a mobility resource is (in terms of expense and commitment) the better the PAS concept is at explaining patterns of ownership. The paper concludes with suggested directions for research to further develop the PAS concept, which include refinements to the quantitative techniques, extension to other structural mobility choices, and qualitative research into the nature of the relationship between people's perceived needs for mobility and their expected activity patterns over longer periods than are observed by most activity and travel surveys.},

Rather than comparing house number, street, city and province individually, we use a string similarity measurement to perform address comparison, which enables us to combine the edit distance with the vector space model to search for potentially matching address candidates by associating them with a similarity matching score. Upon evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques, we introduce an algorithm for effective address matching, called Term-Weighted Dissimilarity, which combines edit distance similarity with Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency weighting. We implement this algorithm in software and show its effectiveness via a real application for address matching and correction based on Canada Post's address standard.},

  abstract = {The geographic mismatch between where blacks reside \& where jobs are located is frequently cited as contributing to the growing black underclass in the nation's urban centers. The "spatial mismatch" hypothesis provides a framework for identifying several facets of change in the comparative employment circumstances of central city black \& white men. Specifically, black-white differences in underemployment are examined during the 1970-1982 period, employing the Labor Utilization Framework of Clifford C. Clogg \& Teresa A. Sullivan (see SA 32:4/84O2137). Using data from the Current Population Survey, the results provide little basis for optimism about the absolute or relative employment circumstances of urban black men. The analysis reveals that: (1) underemployment increased over time for both whites \& blacks, but especially among young adults \& those with low education; (2) racial polarization accelerated during 1970-1982 in US central cities, as the absolute gap in underemployment between blacks \& whites increased substantially; (3) the significance of race increased over time, regardless of age group, level of education, or temporal macroeconomic shifts; \& (4) the effects of education \& age increased over time, suggesting a growing SC- \& age-based bifurcation in the adequacy of employment in US central cities. 6 Tables, 1 Figure, 48 References.

Existing studies related to FFC mainly focus on the analysis of operational management and user preferences. Efforts to model the dynamic choices of free-floating shared cars (SCs) in individuals' daily multi-modal multi-activity trip chains have still been rare. This study proposes a tolerance-based dynamic user equilibrium model of activity-travel scheduling that formulates free-floating SC as an alternative transport mode for conducting daily activities. The model embeds the choice of SC into daily trip chains by extending the state-of-the-art multi-state supernetwork representation. The dynamic traffic flows and supply-demand interactions of SCs are captured endogenously. Moreover, traveler heterogeneity and different pricing schemes are taken into account. A path-flow swapping method is suggested to solve the tolerance-based dynamic user equilibrium model. Numerical examples of various scenarios demonstrate that fleet size, distribution, and rental-parking price of FFC significantly influence the choice of SC and activity-travel pattern.},

The Chinese government has implemented control measures including setting up special hospitals and travel restriction to mitigate the spread. We propose conceptual models for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan with the consideration of individual behavioural reaction and governmental actions, e.g., holiday extension, travel restriction, hospitalisation and quarantine. We employe the estimates of these two key components from the 1918 influenza pandemic in London, United Kingdom, incorporated zoonotic introductions and the emigration, and then compute future trends and the reporting ratio. The model is concise in structure, and it successfully captures the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, and thus sheds light on understanding the trends of the outbreak.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Method: Existing data sources were used to model effects, in the urban setting in New Zealand, of varying the proportion of vehicle kilometres travelled by bicycle instead of light motor vehicle. Results: Shifting 5\% of vehicle kilometres to cycling would reduce vehicle travel by approximately 223 million kilometres each year, save about 22 million litres of fuel and reduce transport-related greenhouse emissions by 0.4\%. The health effects would include about 116 deaths avoided annually as a result of increased physical activity, six fewer deaths due to local air pollution from vehicle emissions, and an additional five cyclist fatalities from road crashes. In economic terms, including only fatalities and using the NZ Ministry of Transport Value of a Statistical Life, the health effects of a 5\% shift represent net savings of about \$200 million per year. Conclusion: The health benefits of moving from cars to bikes heavily outweigh the costs of injury from road crashes. Implications: Transport policies that encourage bicycle use will help to reduce air pollution and greenhouse emissions and improve public health.},

The key design decisions considered are: the number and locations of bicycle stations in the system, the creation of bicycle lanes between bicycle stations, the selection of paths of users between origins and destinations, and the inventory levels of sharing bicycles to be held at the bicycle stations. The design decisions are made with consideration for both total cost and service levels (measured both by the availability rate for rental requests at the pick-up rental stations and coverage of the origins and destinations). The optimal design of this system requires an integrated view of the travel costs of users, bicycle inventory costs and facility costs of bicycle stations and bicycle lanes as well as service levels. The purpose of this study is to create a formal model that provides such an integrated view, and to develop methods for obtaining solutions for the design variables in practical situations. The complexity of the problem precludes the exact solution of the optimization problem for instances of realistic size, and so we propose a heuristic method for efficiently finding near-optimal solutions. In the test problem for which enumeration is possible, the heuristic solution is within 2\% optimal. Finally, a numerical example is created to illustrate the model and proposed solution algorithm.},

The results show that: 1) PB and FFBS are more attractive for long-distance travel enthusiasts compared with PBS, PB is rarely used for transfer in suburbs while FFBS is the most desirable in connecting other travel modes. The theft problem and high maintenance costs are main obstacles for PB. 2) The elderly, high-income and non-student groups in inflexible travel activities show a preference for PBS, while the young, low-income and student groups in flexible travel demands have a tendency towards FFBS. 3) PB and PBS imped the use of FFBS to a certain extent, while PB seems to have less impact on PBS. 4) FFBS is desirable in temporary travel demand while PBS is more preferable in fixed demand. Interestingly, residents with registered permanent residence tend to use PBS while those without registered permanent residence prefer FFBS.

In order to explore the differences of travel behavior among private bicycle (PB), public bicycle sharing (PBS) and FFBS, a survey was conducted in Kunming, China in 2018.

We use the term social sensing for such individual-level big geospatial data and the associated analysis methods. The word sensing suggests two natures of the data. First, they can be viewed as the analogue and complement of remote sensing, as big data can capture well socioeconomic features while conventional remote sensing data do not have such privilege. Second, in social sensing data, each individual plays the role of a sensor. This article conceptually bridges social sensing with remote sensing and points out the major issues when applying social sensing data and associated analytics. We also suggest that social sensing data contain rich information about spatial interactions and place semantics, which go beyond the scope of traditional remote sensing data. In the coming big data era, GIScientists should investigate theories in using social sensing data, such as data representativeness and quality, and develop new tools to deal with social sensing data.},

Within travel demand, long-distance trips represent a significant amount of the total vehicle-kilometers travelled, in contrast to commuting trips. Consequently, they pay a relevant role in the economic, social and environmental impacts of transportation. This paper describes the development of a microscopic long-distance travel demand model for the Province of Ontario (Canada) and analyzes the sensitivity to the implementation of a new high speed rail corridor. Trip generation, destination choice and mode choice models were developed for this research. Multinomial logit models were estimated and calibrated using the Travel Survey for Residents in Canada (TSRC). It was complemented with location-based social network data from Foursquare, improving the description of activities and diverse land uses at the destinations. Level of service of the transit network was defined by downloading trip time, frequency and fare using the planning service Rome2rio. New scenarios were generated to simulate the impacts of a new high speed rail corridor by varying rail travel times, frequencies and fares of the rail services. As a result, a significant increase of rail modal shares was measured, directly proportional to speed and frequency and inversely proportional to price.},

However, such physical characteristics are not the only features of neighborhoods that potentially affect health. Neighborhoods also matter because of the nature of their social organization. This study examined social capital as a potential neighborhood characteristic influencing health. Using a cross-sectional study design which linked counts of death for persons 45\textendash 64 years by race and sex to neighborhood indicators of social capital and poverty for 342 Chicago neighborhoods in the USA, we tested the ecological association between neighborhood-level social capital and mortality rates, taking advantage of the community survey data collected as part of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. We estimated a hierarchical generalized linear model to examine the association of race and sex specific mortality rates to social capital. Overall, neighborhood social capital\textemdash as measured by reciprocity, trust, and civic participation\textemdash was associated with lower neighborhood death rates, after adjustment for neighborhood material deprivation. Specifically, higher levels of neighborhood social capital were associated with lower neighborhood death rates for total mortality as well as death from heart disease and ``other'' causes for White men and women and, to a less consistent extent, for Blacks. However, there was no association between social capital and cancer mortality. Although, the findings from this study extend the state-level findings linking social capital to health to the level of neighborhoods, much work remains to be carried out before social capital can be widely applied to improve population health, including establishing standards of measurement, and exploring the potential ``downsides'' of social capital.},

The statistical results show that the familiar strength of the gravity model is matched by that of the intervening opportunities model, but only when all cities are analyzed together. The disaggregation of cities by size and region (hierarchy) leads to a spotty performance by both models. The generality of the gravity and intervening opportunities models is thus called into question, and the potency of the hierarchical city organization as a contributing influence determining air traffic flows is demonstrated.},

We explore the possibility of using the data to reveal general bikeability patterns in 202 major Chinese cities. This process is conducted by constructing a bikeability rating system,  the Mobike Riding Index (MRI), to measure bikeability in terms of usage frequency and the built environment. We first investigated mass ridership data and relevant supporting data; we then established the MRI framework and calculated MRI scores accordingly. This study finds that people tend  to ride shared bikes at speeds close to 10 km/h for an average distance of 2 km roughly three times a day. The MRI results show that at the street level, the weekday and weekend MRI distributions are analogous, with an average score of 49.8 (range 0\textendash 100). At the township level, high-scoring  townships are those close to the city centre; at the city level, the MRI is unevenly distributed, with high-MRI cities along the southern coastline or in the middle inland area. These patterns have policy implications for urban planners and policy-makers. This is the first and largest-scale  study to incorporate mobile bike-share data into bikeability measurements, thus laying the groundwork for further research.},

This heterogeneity is problematic for decision makers tasked with encouraging more sustainable commuter patterns. Numerical models, based on real commuting data, have great potential to aid the decision making process. However, we contend that new approaches are needed to advance knowledge about the social and geographical factors that relate to the diversity of commuter patterns, if policies targeted to specific individuals or places are to be effective. To this end, the paper presents a spatial microsimulation approach, which combines individual-level survey data with geographically aggregated census results to tackle the problem. This method overcomes the limitations imposed by the lack of available geocoded micro-data. Further, it allows a range of scales of analysis to be pursued in parallel and provides insights into both the types of area and individual that would benefit most from specific interventions.},

  abstract = {Regional transportation plans describe comprehensive planning processes and visions, but long-range transportation planning is only one among many decision sites for transit investment. As most plans are only partially implemented, this research aims to illuminate the factors that determine which transit projects are implemented. It combines case study research (Miami, Orlando, and Boston), with quantitative analysis of federal transit funding. The work addresses three broad questions about metropolitan decision making and action: how does significant action happen across jurisdictions? What is the state and federal role in metropolitan governance? How does equity fare in implementation? In each of three papers, I start at a different government scale: metropolitan planning organization (MPO), state, and nation. The first paper describes critical decision making processes external to MPO planning. Case studies of Boston and Miami demonstrate that MPO planning responded to, rather than determined, transit implementation choices. Due to the influence of external decisions or bypasses, I argue federal directives for equity in regional transportation planning were insufficient to advance equity in Miami and Boston. Community mobilization in Boston was sustained and moderately successful; advocacy groups advanced two projects toward implementation. Next, I examine the sub-national state's role in transit implementation, based on projects proposed in Miami and Orlando. The Florida Department of Transportation adopted a leadership role for projects that had greater economic significance and regional consensus behind them. By selectively contributing capacity, "power to," state actors exerted "power over" regional outcomes in Orlando and Miami. The third paper presents a quantitative analysis of the federal New Starts program, which funds transit expansion. Local financial commitment most correlates with federal funding, according to statistical results. All funded projects met a minimum threshold of benefits. Yet, the Federal Transit Administration was not more likely to fund projects with higher benefits ratings. Findings suggest regionally significant action happens not simply nor easily through planning, but instead through established government entities and through the mobilization of capacity. Altshuler and Luberoff's "bottom-up" federalism is a useful concept to describe how powerful federal actors respond to and enable action at smaller scales. In this conceptual frame, local initiative and mobilization are pivotal, aligning with increasing interest in governance. At the same time, however, findings indicate the need to further develop governance as an analytic category that incorporates multiple types of power and spheres of action. In addition, this research shows that equity advocates can sometimes affect outcomes. Due to existing constraints for metropolitan planning organizations, the conclusion describes options to strengthen or alter their role. I conclude with reflections on the ideal rail deal. Political will behind infrastructure investment can be an opportunity to enable other critical environmental and equity interventions.},

To get more attraction and profits, car-sharing companies are focusing on the customers' interests and rights. In order to better address the issue, several successful car-sharing organizations and sharing concept are introduced firstly, and next we concentrate on the benefits of this new traffic mode. Thirdly, the characteristics of car-sharing members are discussed, and experimental results indicate that car-sharing is often used by some specific population. Further, existing problems/solutions in parking area and person-to-person car-sharing system are expounded. And parking reservation strategies are proposed to balance the demand and supply of parking space concurrently. Finally, this work takes Uber as an example to explore the legitimacy of car-sharing organizations, which turns out that these organizations do not need more regulations and the life cycle of shared cars is investigated as well.},

What precisely constitutes transport poverty is not adequately articulated within academic, policy or infrastructure design literature. This paper aims to demonstrate how the different ways that academic studies and policy programmes have defined and recorded the problem of transport poverty is directly related to the ways in which it has been subsequently addressed in practice. The overall impression is one of inadequacy, fragmentation, inconsistency and tokenistic treatment of an issue that potentially affects anywhere between 10 to 90\% of all households, depending on which definition is used and which country is being considered. This suggests that it is a far greater problem than the transport profession has previously been prepared to recognise and one that requires its urgent attention given the continuing trends for mass migration, urbanisation and wealth concentration within and between the `global north' and `global south'.},

  abstract = {The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed a growing interest amongst UK academics and policy makers in the issue of transport disadvantage and, more innovatively, how this might relate to growing concerns about the social exclusion of low income groups and communities. Studies (predominantly in the United Kingdom) began to make more explicit the links policy between poverty, transport disadvantage, access to key services and economic and social exclusion (see for example Church and Frost, 2000; TRaC, 2000, Lucas et al., 2001, Kenyon, 2003, Kenyon et al., 2003, Hodgson and Turner, 2003; Raje, 2003). By 2003, the UK Social Exclusion Unit had published and its now internationally recognised report on this subject, which subsequently resulted in the development of a set of transport policy guidances to local authorities in England to deliver what is now commonly referred to as accessibility planning as part of their Local Transport Plans (Department for Transport, 2006). Since this time, researchers, policy makers and practitioners in several other countries became interested in adopting a social exclusion approach to transport planning, largely because of its utility in identifying the role of transport, land use planning and service delivery decisions in creating and reinforcing poverty and social disadvantage. Eight years on from the SEU report, we can begin to reflect on the extent to which a social exclusion approach to the research of transport disadvantage has been successful in opening up new avenues of research enquiry and/or identifying new theoretical perspectives and/or methodological approaches. The paper begins by briefly revisiting the basic theories and core definitions which underpin and inform a social exclusion perspective. It then considers how these have been translated and understood in terms of transport. Secondly, it considers some of the emergent empirical research of transport-related exclusion that has attempted to measure and model the interactions between transport and mobility inequalities and relational negative social outcomes. Thirdly, it offers observations on progress in some key areas of policy and practice, with specific reference to the UK and Australia. It concludes by suggesting how further progress might be made on this issue and considers whether the social exclusion agenda is still a relevant approach for achieving this.},

Quantifying landscape pattern and its change is essential for the monitoring and assessment of ecological consequences of urbanization. Combining gradient analysis with landscape metrics, we attempted to quantify the spatial pattern of urbanization in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona, USA. Several landscape metrics were computed along a 165 km long and 15 km wide transect with a moving window. The research was designed to address four research questions: How do different land use types change with distance away from the urban center? Do different land use types have their own unique spatial signatures? Can urbanization gradients be detected using landscape pattern analysis? How do the urban gradients differ among landscape metrics? The answers to these questions were generally affirmative and informative. The results showed that the spatial pattern of urbanization could be reliably quantified using landscape metrics with a gradient analysis approach, and the location of the urbanization center could be identified precisely and consistently with multiple indices. Different land use types exhibited distinctive, but not necessarily unique, spatial signatures that were dependent on specific landscape metrics. The changes in landscape pattern along the transect have important ecological implications, and quantifying the urbanization gradient, as illustrated in this paper, is an important first step to linking pattern with processes in urban ecological studies.},

The gravity-based method considers a nearby physician more accessible than a remote one and discounts a physician's availability by a gravity-based potential. The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the FCA method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model. The methods may be used to help the US Department of Health and Human Services and state health departments improve designation of Health Professional Shortage Areas.},

Such possibilities are founded upon an increasingly fine-grained electronic connectivity of people, places and objects allied to powerful data gathering and processing capabilities. Urban mobility of the future could be transformed, with developments such as: new forms of propulsion; new forms of vehicle control; changing business models of ownership and use; mobile technologies that equip and empower individuals; and opportunities to undertake activities without the need to travel. `Smart' is the order of the day. Smart urban mobility conjures up a sense of new opportunity; of progress. However, what is really meant by smart? This paper examines this question, revealing a lack of consensus in terms of smart cities and a paucity of literature seeking to make sense of smart urban mobility. The paper considers how smart relates to sustainable, raising concerns about potentially dichotomous constituencies of commentators and discourses. Critical commentary associated with smart includes caution that large corporations are exerting significant influence in the era of smart in pursuit of goals that may not strongly align with those of urban planners concerned with social and environmental sustainability as well as economic prosperity. The paper puts forward and explores the following definition of smart urban mobility: ``connectivity in towns and cities that is affordable, effective, attractive and sustainable''. This is intended to help draw the paradigms of smart and sustainable closer together towards a common framework for urban mobility development.},

Most existing methods of assessing pedestrian quality fail to take into account micro-scale landscape and urban design elements that significantly enhance the pedestrian experience, and those few that do are difficult and time-consuming to use. The proposed rating system is (a) context-sensitive, (b) capacity-sensitive, (c) takes into account micro-scale design factors, (d) is feasible to use in a professional planning practice setting, and (e) has built-in flexibility.},

This article serves as a pilot study of three central aspects of sociological research concerning the impact of local agriculture on local communities: food equity, social integration, and natural human capital. Methods. Four CSA farmers, four partners in a direct-market organic farm, and four community garden site coordinators working in the Intervale, a local agriculture project in Burlington, Vermont, were interviewed in person for this research. Additionally, the author collected observational data in the Intervale, at two local farmers' markets, and as a member of a local community garden. Result. Different modes of local agricultural production have distinctive effects on the local population with regard to equitable access to healthy food, social inclusion, and experiential knowledge of the natural world. Conclusions. Given class-based disparities in local agricultural participation, local food projects should consider promoting programs designed for broader social inclusion, including subsidized farmer-to-family coupons.},

  abstract = {Inefficient collection and scheduling procedures negatively affect residential curbside collection (RCC) efficiency, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and cost. As Florida aims to achieve a 75\% recycling goal by 2020, municipalities have switched to single-stream recycling to improve recycling efficiency. Waste diversion and increased collection cost have forced some municipalities to reduce garbage collection frequency. The goal of this study was to explore the trade-offs between environmental and economic factors of RCC systems in Florida by evaluating the RCC system design of 25 different Central Florida communities. These communities were grouped into four sets based on their RCC garbage, yard waste, and recyclables collection design, i.e., frequency of collection and use of dual-stream (DS) or single-stream (SS) recyclables collection system. For the 25 communities studied, it was observed that RCC programs that used SS recyclables collection system recycled approximately 15\textendash 35\%, by weight of the waste steam, compared to 5\textendash 20\% for programs that used DS. The GHG emissions associated with collection programs were estimated to be between 36 and 51kg CO2eq per metric ton of total household waste (garbage and recyclables), depending on the garbage collection frequency, recyclables collection system (DS or SS), and recyclables compaction. When recyclables offsets were considered, the GHG emissions associated with programs using SS were estimated between -760 and -560, compared to between -270 and -210kg CO2eq per metric ton of total waste for DS programs. These data suggest that RCC system design can significantly impact recyclables generation rate and efficiency, and consequently determine environmental and economic impacts of collection systems. Recycling participation rate was found to have a significant impact on the environmental and financial performance of RCC programs. Collection emissions were insignificant compared to the benefits of recycling. SS collection of recyclables provided cost benefits compared to DS, mainly due to faster collection time.},

Achieving good health is not simply a matter of making the right choices as an individual, the research demonstrates: it's the product of large-scale political and economic forces. Understanding these forces, and what we can do to correct them, should be critical not only to doctors but to sociologists and students of the urban environment\textemdash and no city offers more inspiring examples for action to overcome social injustice in health than Chicago.},

The task of integrating and reconciling these impacts poses challenges, because they are incommensurable, and they affect different groups differentially. Further, impacts such as those related to social equity are hard to define and measure. In this paper we address two inter-related questions: How is social equity conceptualized, operationalized, and prioritized relative to environmental and other objectives; and how might social equity be more effectively integrated in urban transportation plans in North America? We critically analyze how social equity is incorporated into transportation plans in 18 large North American metropolitan areas, in terms of the quality of the related objectives, how meaningfully their achievement is assessed through the choice of performance measures or indicators, and their prioritization relative to other objectives. We observe that social equity goals and objectives are in many cases not translated into clearly specified objectives, and appropriate measures for assessing their achievement in a meaningful, disaggregated manner are often lacking. At the same time, there are good examples of social equity objectives and measures in several plans. In general, there is a stronger focus on the local environment (and congestion reduction) than on social equity in the plans. We end the paper with a discussion related to considerations for generating objectives and measures for better integrating social equity into urban transportation plans.},

The results show that the most important variables in explaining the choice of frequency of telecommuting from home were the presence of small children in the household (irrespective of respondent gender), the number of people in the household, gender of respondent, number of vehicles in the household, whether respondent recently changed departure time for personal reasons, degree of control over scheduling of different job tasks, supervisory status of respondent, the ability to borrow a computer from work if necessary, and a family orientation. The empirical analysis also shows that model results are not transferable among the three organizations studied.},

We then show that support for transit spending is correlated more with belief in its collective rather than private benefits\textemdash transit supporters are more likely to report broad concerns about traffic congestion and air pollution than to report wanting to use transit themselves. These findings suggest a collective action problem, since without riders transit cannot deliver collective benefits.

We use publicly available demographic study as input data and Rockwell Automation Arena\textregistered{} 14 software for processing and modelling. Various categories of data were evaluated based on results from 2,057 interviews with parking users. Our comparison of two models, everyday driver behaviour model and adaptive experimental optimisation model, shows a great potential in reducing parking search time. The analysed results show that search time decreases with information availability about three main criteria: acceptable walking distance, price and driving time.},

Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner pursued evidence steadily and relentlessly, interviewed the important players, investigated untapped sources, and uncovered a bruising story of cynical and cruel disregard for health and human rights. This resulting expos\'e is full of startling revelations, provocative arguments, and disturbing conclusions--all based on remarkable research and information gleaned from secret industry documents. This book reveals for the first time the public relations campaign that the lead industry undertook to convince Americans to use its deadly product to paint walls, toys, furniture, and other objects in America's homes, despite a wealth of information that children were at risk for serious brain damage and death from ingesting this poison. This book highlights the immediate dangers ordinary citizens face because of the relentless failure of industrial polluters to warn, inform, and protect their workers and neighbors. It offers a historical analysis of how corporate control over scientific research has undermined the process of proving the links between toxic chemicals and disease. The authors also describe the wisdom, courage, and determination of workers and community members who continue to voice their concerns in spite of vicious opposition. Readable, ground-breaking, and revelatory, Deceit and Denial provides crucial answers to questions of dangerous environmental degradation, escalating corporate greed, and governmental disregard for its citizens' safety and health. After eleven years, Markowitz and Rosner update their work with a new epilogue that outlines the attempts these industries have made to undermine and create doubt about the accuracy of the information in this book.},

  abstract = {For the past three decades, we have written on the history of occupational and environmental health, authoring books and articles on lead poisoning, silicosis, asbestosis, and angiosarcoma of the liver, among other diseases. One book, Deceit and Denial, focused specifically on the chemical and lead industries. Because of the rarity of historians who study this history, we have been asked to testify on behalf of workers who allege harm from these industrial materials and by state, county, and local governments who seek redress for environmental damages and funds to prevent future harm to children. In about 2010, we began testifying in law suits brought by individuals who claimed that they had suffered from cancers, specifically non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, because of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in their bodies. At that time, we wrote a Report to the Court about industry knowledge of the dangers of PCBs to workers and the environment. More recently, we have been approached by attorneys representing government agencies on the West Coast of the United States which are seeking funds to abate PCB pollution in their ports, bays, and waterways. The focus of these lawsuits is the Monsanto Corporation, the sole producer of PCBs in the United States from the 1930s through 1977. Through these law suits, an enormous trove of previously private Monsanto reports, papers, memos, letters, and studies have been made available to us and this paper is the result of our examination of these hundreds of thousands of pages. The documents from this collection (with the exception of privileged materials that Monsanto has not made public, and upon which we have not relied) are available on www.ToxicDocs.org, the website we have developed with Professor Merlin Chowkwanyun of Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health. (Almost all of the references that are from this collection can be accessed by readers by clicking on the reference hyperlink.) This monograph is adapted from a report to the court that was originally produced for litigation on behalf of plaintiffs in PCB lawsuits. We are grateful to the Journal of Public Health Policy for publishing this detailed examination of these documents and we hope it will stimulate further research into this important, and now public, archive of industry records.},

Parking policies are often compromised in their effectiveness due to the perceived tension between three of the objectives that parking supports: regeneration, restraint and revenue. In particular the belief that parking restraint measures could damage the attractiveness of city centres to both retail and commercial enterprises limits the political acceptability of pricing policies and planning. This paper presents a review of the evidence base upon which commuter, leisure and shopping and residential parking policies are based. Whilst underdeveloped, the literature suggests that greater attention should be given to analysing and presenting the accessibility impacts that different parking restraint measures have on travelers of all modes. The research base in many instances does not support, or provides evidence counter to, the assumption that parking restraint makes centres less attractive. Further disaggregate work is needed to understand how context specific these findings might be.},

  abstract = {Biking is increasingly being recognized as a highly sustainable form of transportation. Consequently, a growing number of American cities have seen tremendous growth in bicycle travel, in part because many cities are also investing resources into improving bicycling infrastructure. Aside from the environmental advantages, there is now growing evidence to suggest that cities with higher bicycling rates also have better road safety records. This study attempts to better understand this phenomenon of lower fatality rates in bike-oriented cities by examining 11 years of road safety data (1997\textendash 2007) from 24 California cities. The analysis included accounting for crashes across all severity levels, as well as for three classes of road users: vehicle occupants, pedestrians, and bicyclists. Additionally, we looked at issues of street and street network design to help determine the role that these features might play in affecting both bicycling rates and road safety outcomes. Overall, cities with a high bicycling rate among the population generally show a much lower risk of fatal crashes for all road users when compared to the other cities in our database. The fact that this pattern of low fatality risk is consistent for all classes of road users strongly suggests that the crashes in cities with a high bicycling rate are occurring at lower speeds. This agrees with the finding that street network density was one of the most notable differences found between the safer and less safe cities. Our data suggest that improving the streets and street networks to better accommodate bicycles may lead to a self-reinforcing cycle that can help enhance overall safety for all road users.Environmental Practice 13:16\textendash 27 (2011)},

While existing models of parking search and choice behavior do provide insight into the basic dynamics of parking in cities, as well as into the phenomenon of drivers cruising for on-street parking, virtually all models discussed in the literature ignore a number of key factors that influence parking behavior and parking dynamics. This paper makes a first step in this direction, by proposing a non-spatial model of parking search and an explicit geosimulation model of the parking process, termed PARKAGENT, which accounts for street network, drivers' decisions and their destination. We employ both models to analyze the phenomena of cruising for parking and compare the models' outcomes, focusing on the impact of space on parking dynamics. We estimate the main characteristics of these dynamics, and specify the conditions under which spatial effects are, or are not, important for analyzing parking. In particular, we demonstrate that traffic engineers' recommendation that about 15\% of all on-street parking places should remain vacant to ensure easy ingress and egress and prevent cruising for parking can be decreased to 7\% and even less, especially in case of relatively low parking turnover levels. The paper ends with a short discussion, in which we explore the implications of our model study for establishing urban parking policies.},

That distribution, we propose, is one where the maximum gap between the lowest and highest accessibility, both by mode and in space, should be limited, while attempting to maximize average access. We then review transportation planning practice for a priori distributional goals and find little explicit guidance in conventional and even justice-oriented transportation planning and analyses. We end with a discussion of the implications for practice.},

Bikesharing has been found to decrease driving and increase bicycling. But shifts in public transit have been mixed. The authors evaluate survey data from two U.S. cities to explore who is shifting toward and away from public transit as a result of bikesharing. The authors explore this question by mapping geocoded home and work locations of respondents within Washington DC and Minneapolis. Respondents were mapped by their modal shift toward or away from bus and rail transit. The results show that in Washington DC, those shifting toward bus and rail transit live on the urban periphery, whereas those living in the urban core tend to use public transit less. In Minneapolis, the shift toward rail extends to the urban core, while the modal shift for bus transit is more dispersed. The authors analyze socio-demographics associated with modal shift through cross-tabulations and four ordinal regression models. Common attributes associated with shifting toward public transit include increased age, being male, living in lower density areas, and longer commute distances. The authors conclude with a discussion of the final results in the context of bikesharing's impacts on other cities throughout North America.},

To reproduce their work, the authors of this article factor analyzed 20 indexes of segregation computed in 1990 for three groups in 58 metropolitan areas. They extended Massey and Denton's analysis by expanding the set of metropolitan areas to include all 318 defined for 1990, and they broadened it by carrying out systematic comparisons across ethnic groups. This study's analyses reconfirm the multidimensional nature of residential segregation; however, the authors also find that the indexes recommended by Massey and Denton to measure concentration and clustering do not function quite as well in 1990 as in 1980. Alternative indexes are considered as possibilities, but in the end, using the same indexes is recommended to maintain continuity.},

  abstract = {Environmental pollution of urban areas is one of key factors that state authorities and local agencies have to consider in the decision-making process. To find a compromise among many criteria, spatial analysis extended by geostatistical methods and dynamic models has to be carried out. In this case, spatial analysis includes processing of a wide range of air, water and soil pollution data and possibly noise assessment and waste management data. Other spatial inputs consist of data from remote sensing and GPS field measurements. Integration and spatial data management are carried out within the framework of a geographic information system (GIS). From a modeling point of view, GIS is used mainly for the preprocessing and postprocessing of data to be displayed in digital map layers and visualized in 3D scenes. Moreover, for preprocessing and postprocessing, deterministic and geostatistical methods (IDW, ordinary kriging) are used for spatial interpolation; geoprocessing and raster algebra are used in multi-criteria evaluation and risk assessment methods. GIS is also used as a platform for spatio-temporal analyses or for building relationships between the GIS database and stand-alone modeling tools. A case study is presented illustrating the application of spatial analysis to the urban areas of Prague. This involved incorporating environmental data from monitoring networks and field measurements into digital map layers. Extra data inputs were used to represent the 3D concentration fields of air pollutants (ozone, NO2) measured by differential absorption LIDAR. ArcGIS was used to provide spatial data management and analysis, extended by modeling tools developed internally in the ArcObjects environment and external modules developed with MapObjects. Ordinary kriging methods were employed to predict ozone concentrations in selected 3D locations together with estimates of variability. Higher ozone concentrations were found above crossroads with their heavy traffic than above the surrounding areas. Ozone concentrations also varied with height above the digital elevation model. Processed data, spatial analysis and models are integrated within the framework of the GIS project, providing an approach that state and local authorities can use to address environmental protection issues.},

  abstract = {Appropriate microeconomic foundations of mobility are decisive for successful policy design in transportation and, in particular, for the challenge of climate change mitigation. Recent research suggests that behavior in transportation cannot be adequately represented by the standard approach of revealed preferences. Moreover, mobility choices are influenced by factors widely regarded as normatively irrelevant. Here we draw on insights from behavioral economics, psychology and welfare theory to examine how transport users make mobility decisions and when it is desirable to modify them through policy interventions. First, we explore systematically which preferences, heuristics and decision processes are relevant for mobility-specific behavior, such as mode choice. We highlight the influence of infrastructure on the formation of travel preferences. Second, we argue that the behavioral account of decision-making requires policy-makers to take a position on whether transport policies should be justified by appealing to preference satisfaction or to raising subjective well-being. This distinction matters because of the (i) influence of infrastructure on preference formation, (ii) health benefits from non-motorized mobility, (iii) negative impact of commuting on happiness and (iv) status-seeking behavior of individuals. The orthodox approach of only internalizing externalities is insufficient because it does not allow for the evaluation of these effects. Instead, our analysis suggests that transport demand modeling should consider behavioral effects explicitly.},

  abstract = {Using a formulation of the spatial mismatch theory that combines both spatial and skill dimensions as an explanation for minority, urban joblessness and a data set for the 100 US cities with largest African-American populations, the authors develop a simple taxonomy that categorizes cities by the degree of mismatch between labor supply (unemployment) and labor demand (relative number of jobs). They show that African-Americans are disproportionately located in cities with either an intraurban incongruity between labor supply and labor demand or an inadequate labor demand to cover labor supply. Cities that contain such mismatches have higher levels of joblessness for African-Americans, ceteris paribus, and have increased levels of social and economic dysfunction. Their results are therefore consistent with the increased spatial inaccessibility to jobs and social isolation faced by the approximately one-third of the African-American population that resides in urban areas with large African-American populations.

First, we describe the strengths and weaknesses of three different datasets on subprime mortgages using information from LoanPerformance, HUD, and HMDA. These datasets embody different definitions of subprime mortgages. We show that estimates of the number of subprime originations are somewhat sensitive to which types of mortgages are categorized as subprime. Second, we describe what parts of the country and what sorts of neighborhoods had more subprime originations in 2005, and how these patterns differed for purchase and refinance mortgages. Subprime originations appear to be heavily concentrated in fast-growing parts of the country with considerable new construction, such as Florida, California, Nevada, and the Washington DC area. These locations saw house prices rise at faster-than-average rates relative to their own history and relative to the rest of the country. However, this link between construction, house prices, and subprime lending is not universal, as other markets with high house price growth such as the Northeast did not see especially high rates of subprime usage. Subprime loans were also heavily concentrated in zip codes with more residents in the moderate credit score category and more black and Hispanic residents. Areas with lower income and higher unemployment had more subprime lending, but these associations are smaller in magnitude.},

They have discovered that changing the design of a single street is not enough: they must upend the way transportation agencies operate. Completing Our Streets begins with the story of how the complete streets movement united bicycle riders, transportation practitioners and agencies, public health leaders, older Americans, and smart growth advocates to dramatically re-frame the discussion of transportation safety. Next, it explores why the transportation field has been so resistant to change\textemdash and how the movement has broken through to create a new multi-modal approach.In Completing Our Streets, Barbara McCann, founder of the National Complete Streets Coalition, explains that the movement is not about street design. Instead, practitioners and activists have changed the way projects are built by focusing on three strategies: reframe the conversation; build a broad base of political support; and provide a clear path to a multi-modal process. McCann shares stories of practitioners in cities and towns from Charlotte, North Carolina to Colorado Springs, Colorado who have embraced these strategies to fundamentally change the way transportation projects are chosen, planned, and built.The complete streets movement is based around a simple idea: streets should be safe for people of all ages and abilities, whether they are walking, driving, bicycling, or taking the bus. Completing Our Streets gives practitioners and activists the strategies, tools, and inspiration needed to translate this idea into real and lasting change in their communities.},

During the 1980s, the region's economic base and social fabric changed dramatically with a continued loss of manufacturing employment, rise of service employment, growth of households headed by women, and accelerated suburbanization. Using 1980 and 1990 PUMS data, we analyze gender differences in commuting times in central and suburban areas for African American, Latino, and White workers. We also analyze the determinants of commuting time for each gender/race group in 1980 and 1990. The results indicate that, despite significant restructuring, average commuting times have changed only slightly. Moreover, the major determinants of commuting times have remained stable: wages and means of transportation strongly affect work-trip length for all gender/race groups in all parts of the urban region. Household characteristics have the most significant impacts on commuting times for male workers. Marriage lengthens commuting times for men of all race/ethnic groups, reflecting the domestic division of labor and time for married couples. For White women, particularly in the suburbs, the presence of children leads to shorter work trips.},

Gender differences in labor market segmentation are central to the spatial mismatch debate, both in their effects on wages, occupation, and transportation access and their links to place-based variation in commuting and spatial access to employment. Using 1980 PUMS data for northern New Jersey, we examine the spatial mismatch between jobs and residences for employed black and Hispanic women and the links between labor market segmentation and spatial mismatch. Minority women have poorer spatial access to jobs than white women, but they typically have better spatial access to employment than minority men. The mismatch is greatest for African-American women, reflecting their heavy reliance on mass transit and poor spatial access to employment in all economic sectors. Latina workers have more localized labor markets, but also the lowest earning of any group. For Latinas, the primary problem is not spatial access to employment but rather a lack of access to well-paying jobs. These differences in mismatch reflect the combined effects of gender-and race-based segmentation and spatial access to employment and transportation. -from Authors},

  abstract = {Parking management strategies have traditionally been used as a means of accommodating traffic demand, with little or no effort made to identify how such strategies might relate to other urban objectives. In this paper, parking management strategies are classified according to the control they exert over the amount of aggregate parking supply, access to parking, spatial distribution of parking supply, or dollar price of parking. Six general categories of urban policy objectives are identified, and the relationship between parking strategies and these objectives analyzed. The parking program in Baltimore is used to illustrate some of the relationships identified in this analysis. This paper concludes that the linkage between parking and the attainment of some urban objectives is potentially quite strong, and that further empirical research is needed to fully establish this relationship. Several different directions for further research are also identified.},

Many state and local governments are scrambling to figure out how and if sharing economy services such as Airbnb, Uber, and Lyft need or can be regulated. Cities large and small are developing new or expanded policies addressing the concerns of residents and interest groups to find a compromise between a potential economic engine and potential nuisances. Drawing on available literature and several case study cities, this paper examines the implications of the sharing economy, specifically the service Airbnb, on local government policymaking. Conclusively, cases are analyzed, policy implications are explored, and the future of policies regarding the sharing economy is discussed.},

Methodological issues associated with the conventional statistical approach to environmental justice research, such as scale of analysis, continue to make assessments of environmental injustice problematic. Geographic information systems (GIS) can be used to facilitate multiscale analysis through the generation of statistical surface representations of both socioeconomic character and environmental risk. Methods. As a case study, U.S. Bureau of the Census and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data sets were used to generate statistical surfaces of socioeconomic character and environmental risk for the southeast Pennsylvania region. Results. Analysis of these statistical surfaces reveals that socioeconomic status decreases with proximity to, and density of, hazardous facilities. Conclusions. Further research calls for incorporating other relevant information, such as amount and toxicity of toxic release, into GIS-based statistical surface representations of risk.},

This paper presents the results of a comparative study of an interdisciplinary pre-health curriculum based in structural competency with a traditional premedical curriculum. The authors describe the interdisciplinary pre-health curriculum, titled Medicine, Health, and Society (MHS) at Vanderbilt University. The authors then use a new survey tool, the Structural Foundations of Health Survey, to evaluate structural skills and sensibilities. The analysis compares MHS majors (n~=~185) with premed science majors (n~=~63) and first-semester freshmen (n~=~91), with particular attention to understanding how structural factors shape health. Research was conducted from August 2015 to December 2016. Results suggest that MHS majors identified and analyzed relationships between structural factors and health outcomes at higher rates and in deeper ways than did premed science majors and freshmen, and also demonstrated higher understanding of structural and implicit racism and health disparities. The skills that MHS students exhibited represent proficiencies increasingly stressed by the MCAT, the AAMC, and other educational bodies that emphasize how contextual factors shape expressions of health and illness.},

Using bus ridership data from the Salt Lake City metropolitan area, we find that extreme weather such as very high and low temperatures, and heavy rainfall reduces public transport ridership, while bus stop shelters have a modest effect on mitigating ridership losses resulting from these adverse weather conditions. The moderating effect of shelters is more pronounced on weekdays, and for bus stops with lower service frequency and fewer transfers. Our research also shows that the installation of bus shelters correlates with a variety of factors including service frequency, land use types, and local socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Overall, our findings suggest that public transport amenities with weather-proof attributes have the potential to retain and attract more ridership on extreme weather days.},

  abstract = {Characterizing near-source spatio-temporal variation is a long -standing challenge in air pollution epidemiology, and common intra-urban modeling approaches [e.g., land use regression (LUR)], do not account for short-term meteorological variation. Atmospheric dispersion modeling approaches, such as AERMOD, can account for near-source pollutant behavior by capturing source-meteorological interactions, but requires external validation and resolved background concentrations. In this study, we integrate AERMOD-based predictions for source-specific fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations into LUR models derived from total ambient PM2.5 measured at 36 unique sites selected to represent different source and elevation profiles, during summer and winter, 2012\textendash 2013 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (PA). We modeled PM2.5 emissions from 207 local stationary sources in AERMOD, utilizing the monitoring locations as receptors, and hourly meteorological information matching each sampling period. Finally, we compare results of the integrated LUR/AERMOD hybrid model to those of the AERMOD~+~background and standard LUR models, at the full domain scale and within a 5~km2 sub-domain surrounding a large industrial facility. The hybrid model improved out-of-sample prediction accuracy by 2\textendash 10\% over LUR alone, though performance differed by season, in part due to within-season temporal variability. We found differences up to 10~{$\mu$}g/m3 in predicted concentrations, and observed the largest differences within the industrial sub-domain. LUR underestimated concentrations from 500 to 2500~m downwind of major sources. The hybrid modeling approach we developed may help to improve intra-urban exposure estimates, particularly in regions of large industrial sources, sharp elevation gradients, or complex meteorology (e.g., frequent inversion events), such as Pittsburgh, PA. More broadly, the approach may inform the development of spatio-temporal modeling frameworks for air pollution exposure assessment for epidemiology.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study has been the develop of a model for designing an efficient parking pricing policy. The aim is an intelligent control and management system of parking pricing integrated with a redefinition of the circulation scheme for a limited traffic zone in the Central Business District (CBD) of Palermo. The transport demand over the entire area of the town has been studied in order to design various parking pricing scenarios with the application of an additional cost on parking inside the selected area of the CBD. This area attracts most of the private vehicular traffic and it is characterized by university faculties, schools, hospitals, offices and commercial areas. The optimal hourly toll is defined by an iterative maximization process of an objective function. This objective function is subject to the following constraint: the percentage of available parking in the various parking zones has to remain major of the 30\%. In this way, the users who need to park close to their final destination can easily find parking. Otherwise it is possible to leave the private car in a ``park and ride'' area and taking a shuttle bus directed towards the zones of the CBD. A basic principle of this pricing policy is the re-use of revenues for two purposes: to design a shuttle bus service that connects the various ``park and ride'' areas to the CBD and to improve the local public transport service on the OD pairs that show high travel demand. At the same time it is necessary to eliminate the stop and go flow in cordon roads to increase the capacity and avoid congestion in these critical links. The method shows that in a very simple, and relatively fast, way is possible to get a proposal for the modification of the parking pricing scheme that makes the city center no longer stifled by private car traffic.},

Purpose: In this article, we document the magnitude of the association between housing conditions and asthma and related respiratory symptoms, present examples of new systems for addressing adverse effects of housing on health, and discuss how planners might require or encourage such innovations. Methods: We use logistic regressions based on household survey data from seven European cities to show the magnitude of the association between housing conditions and noise annoyance and the exacerbation of asthma and related respiratory symptoms. To support our argument that new housing intervention systems show great promise for alleviating current housing-related health challenges, we offer several different examples of green building criteria that incorporate health measures. Results and conclusions: After taking into consideration individual-level characteristics, we found that respondents across a range of cities who were strongly annoyed by general neighborhood noise had twice the odds of a doctor-diagnosed asthma attack or related respiratory symptom than those not at all annoyed. Those strongly annoyed by traffic noise had 68\% higher odds. Drainage problems at the housing unit were associated with 54\% higher odds of experiencing respiratory symptoms, building structural problems with 27\% higher odds, and a leaky roof with 35\% higher odds. We identify healthy housing development, construction, and housing rehabilitation systems as promising initiatives for addressing the web of associations between housing and health. We suggest that funds such as Community Development Block Grants or housing trusts could subsidize such efforts, and various existing planning processes could incorporate health requirements or scoring criteria. Takeaway for practice: There is compelling evidence that housing conditions are associated with poor health. Planners should inform themselves about these and identify opportunities to incorporate health considerations into planning that affects housing. Research support: None.},

The goal represents an heuristic performance measure intended to reduce double parking and cruising for parking, and improve the driver experience; it follows a wave of academic and policy literature that calls for adjusting on-street parking prices to achieve similar occupancy targets. In this paper, we evaluate the relationship between occupancy rules and metrics of direct policy interest, such as the probability of finding a parking space and the amount of cruising. We show how cruising and arrival rates can be simulated or estimated from hourly occupancy data. Further, we evaluate the impacts of the first two years of the San Francisco program, and conclude that rate changes have helped achieve the City's occupancy goal and reduced cruising by 50\%.},

We find mixed results. For one of the four fare changes the decline in ridership is greater in lower-income neighborhoods than it is in higher-income neighborhoods. However, the reverse is found for another fare increase. For two of the increases there is no relationship between income and ridership response. These mixed findings are in line with the prior literature that also found an inconsistent relationship. We hypothesize that there are two competing forces at work. On one hand lower-income groups are more constrained in their budget, but on the other hand they have fewer options for switching to other modes.},

  abstract = {Although plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (pHEVs) can be considered a powerful technology to promote the change from conventional mobility to e-mobility, their real benefits, in terms of CO2 emissions, depend to a great extent on the average efficiency of their Internal Combustion Engine and on the energy source mix which is used to supply the electrical demand of pHEV. Furthermore the operating cost of the vehicle should also be taken into account in the design process, since it represents the main driver in the customer's choice. This article has the purpose of assessing, through numerical simulations, the effects of different technology mixes used to produce electrical energy for the battery recharging, of different Internal Combustion Engines on the pHEV performance, and highlighting the main differences with respect to the regulatory test procedure.},

  abstract = {This book provides a long-overdue vision for a new automobile era. The cars we drive today follow the same underlying design principles as the Model Ts of a hundred years ago and the tail-finned sedans of fifty years ago. In the twenty-first century, cars are still made for twentieth-century purposes. They're well suited for conveying multiple passengers over long distances at high speeds, but inefficient for providing personal mobility within cities--where most of the world's people now live. In this pathbreaking book, William Mitchell and two industry experts reimagine the automobile, describing vehicles of the near future that are green, smart, connected, and fun to drive. They roll out four big ideas that will make this both feasible and timely. First, we must transform the DNA of the automobile, basing it on electric-drive and wireless communication rather than on petroleum, the internal combustion engine, and stand-alone operation. This allows vehicles to become lighter, cleaner, and "smart" enough to avoid crashes and traffic jams. Second, automobiles will be linked by a Mobility Internet that allows them to collect and share data on traffic conditions, intelligently coordinates their movements, and keeps drivers connected to their social networks. Third, automobiles must be recharged through a convenient, cost-effective infrastructure that is integrated with smart electric grids and makes increasing use of renewable energy sources. Finally, dynamically priced markets for electricity, road space, parking space, and shared-use vehicles must be introduced to provide optimum management of urban mobility and energy systems. The fundamental reinvention of the automobile won't be easy, but it is an urgent necessity--to make urban mobility more convenient and sustainable, to make cities more livable, and to help bring the automobile industry out of crisis.Four Big Ideas That Could Transform the Automobile\textbullet{} Base the underlying design principles on electric-drive and wireless communications rather than the internal combustion engine and stand-alone operation\textbullet{} Develop the Mobility Internet for sharing traffic and travel data\textbullet{} Integrate electric-drive vehicles with smart electric grids that use clean, renewable energy sources\textbullet{} Establish dynamically priced markets for electricity, road space, parking space, and shared-use vehicles},

  abstract = {Governance and planning of ecosystem and water management within the California Bay-Delta, a critical component of California's water economy, have been characterized by a range of innovations in collaboration and conflict resolution. Despite legal mandates to incorporate environmental justice, the California Bay-Delta Authority's (CBDA) policy-development process and the subsequent Delta Vision process have systematically marginalized the role of environmental justice in California's water policy. We suggest that environmental justice in Bay-Delta planning can be understood as a ``third party'' with a tenuous seat at the CALFED water management table. As such environmental justice is a useful lens through which to assess the state's broader commitments and capacities relative to equity as a planning principal and outcome. We interpret the fate of environmental justice within Bay-Delta planning as indicative of the inherent tensions between systems based on increasing market dominance and state legitimation and the values of environmental justice based on distributive, procedural, and cognitive justice. We construct a model of marginalization and environmental injustice in collaborative planning to illustrate these tensions. We draw upon experiences of members of the Environmental Justice Sub-Committee of CBDA's Bay Delta Public Advisory Committee, as well as interviews with other key environmental justice interests, and a comprehensive review of internal and public CBDA documents relating to the environmental justice program including budgets and program plans, and ethnographic field work. We conclude that by learning from the mistakes of Bay-Delta planning, a positive model of collaborative, environmental justice-based planning for water and ecosystem management is possible.

This paper proposes a time-varying weighted PT encounter network to model the spreading of infectious diseases through the PT systems. Social activity contacts at both local and global levels are also considered. We select the epidemiological characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a case study along with smart card data from Singapore to illustrate the model at the metropolitan level. A scalable and lightweight theoretical framework is derived to capture the time-varying and heterogeneous network structures, which enables to solve the problem at the whole population level with low computational costs. Different control policies from both the public health side and the transportation side are evaluated. We find that people's preventative behavior is one of the most effective measures to control the spreading of epidemics. From the transportation side, partial closure of bus routes helps to slow down but cannot fully contain the spreading of epidemics. Identifying "influential passengers" using the smart card data and isolating them at an early stage can also effectively reduce the epidemic spreading.},

The first phase in every safety analysis concerns the identification of the hazardous locations. In this respect, a local indicator of spatial association (Moran's I) is improved and applied to determine hot spots locations on highways in Limburg, a province in Belgium. However, the analysis is complicated by the fact that accident data have a very specific nature: they form a Poisson random process rather than a Gaussian random process and they are prone to sparseness. Therefore, the well-established indicator needs some adaptations and simulations are required to determine the underlying distribution of Moran's I. This paper emphasizes the importance of using a correct distribution and indicates what could go wrong otherwise e.g. at policy level.}

No doubt, such visual evidence of marginalized communities disproportionately burdened with noxious facilities has been an important and powerful tool for activists, regulators, and educators. Despite the efficacy of such mappings in demonstrating unjust distributions of waste, critics argue that they do not capture the complicated processes behind this spatial phenomenon. In this paper, we discuss our pursuit of an ``undisciplined'' environmental justice project by using visualization, not solely as the traditional product of research, but also as a process for raising new lines of inquiry into the social and environmental dynamics at work in the landscape. To this end, we present one strategy we have used in our project to construct and creatively visualize a novel dataset on the transnational hazardous waste trade in North America. Specifically, we convened a one-day ``Design Challenge'' with geography students from several sub-disciplines. This event yielded new avenues for international environmental justice research on and visualization of the transnational waste trade, identified methods for and concerns about critical storytelling with large datasets, and highlighted the opportunities and challenges of using critical storytelling to undiscipline EJ research. The paper presents logistics leading up to the Design Challenge, key insights and critical discussion resulting from the day, and interviews conducted one year after the Design Challenge on enduring lessons from the process.},

  abstract = {I believe that empathy is important for democracy. To make this case, I investigate the history of the concept of empathy from its origins in 19th Century German aesthetic philosophy, identifying the three key components of emotion, projection and understanding. The confusion surrounding empathy today arises from its use by later scholars in the psychoanalytic and social psychological tradition. As an alternative, I adapt a multi-dimensional model called the Process Model of Empathy. Empirical research demonstrates that the process of empathy can help individuals overcome various biases and affect outgroup evaluations; these are essential for democratic decisions to give equal consideration to all citizens. I then argue that these findings are important for Chantal Mouffe's theory of agonistic pluralism, making two claims. First, agonistic pluralism cannot function without putting the process of empathy at its heart; second, this implies that agonistic pluralism places too much emphasis on conflict. As an alternative, some combination of agonism and deliberation may be preferable, though whatever theory remains persuasive, the process of empathy must play a central role in democracy.},

  abstract = {City transport systems often struggle to cope with high volumes of traffic and become congested, despite the use of various traffic management strategies. The concentration of traffic around city centres results in pollution and poor urban air quality, although the increasing popularity of electric vehicles is helping ameliorate these effects. One reason for the growing momentum behind electric vehicles is the emergence of mobility operators such as car-sharing companies, who target users wishing to rent out vehicles on a short-term basis. There is currently rapid growth in one-way car-sharing, in which the vehicle can be dropped off at a different location to the pickup point. Crucially, one-way car-sharing gives the opportunity for travellers to utilise car-sharing in conjunction with other modes, such as public transport modes, for their journey provided the requisite intermodal connections are present. This paper looks at how one-way electric vehicle car-sharing systems have the potential to become important components of future city transport systems. The future role of shared autonomous vehicles is also considered.},

  abstract = {The 1970's and 1980's witnessed both substantial conceptual and practical interest in paratransit across Europe and North America, as well as widespread implementation of paratransit services and strategies. Subsequently, the trajectory of paratransit (also often referred to as flexible transport systems) has waned, to the point where it is frequently relegated to a very narrow niche (often related to special needs) in the spectrum of collective transport services. More recently, technological advances have made feasible new and / or improved approaches for organizing and delivering local passenger transportation. With practice, policy and research in paratransit now being impacted by these developments, a new set of possibilities is emerging. Some practitioners have forged ahead over the past decade and implemented services and organizational models that show the way forward for what is possible, sometimes without the benefit of the most advanced available technologies. This book draws on a selection of papers presented at the International Paratransit Conference in Monterey in October 2014 to capture these exciting developments.},

This paper contributes to this line of research by proposing a methodology for including cycling-related indicators in mobility surveys based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), and applying an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to evaluate the structure of latent variables associated with bicycle commuting. The EFA identified six cycling latent variables: Lifestyle, Safety and comfort, Awareness, Direct disadvantages, Subjective norm, and Individual capabilities. These were complemented with a latent variable related to habit: Non-commuting cycling habit. Statistical differences and regression analysis were applied with the cycling latent variables. The study also includes the relationship between objective factors and bicycle commuting, which reveals minor associations. This methodology was applied to the ``starter cycling city'' of Vitoria-Gasteiz (Spain). The results confirm that in this context \textendash in transition to a cyclable city \textendash{} safety and comfort issues are not the main barriers for all commuters, although more progress needs to be made to normalise cycling. A set of customised policy initiatives is recommended in the light of the research findings, including marketing campaigns to encourage non-commuting cycling trips, bicycle measures to target social groups as opposed to individuals, bicycle-specific programs such as ``Bike-to-work Days'', and cycling courses.},

Two different modelling techniques have been employed: computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and operational dispersion modelling. The CFD simulations have been carried out by using the RNG k\textendash{$\varepsilon$} turbulence model included in the commercial suite FLUENT, while operational modelling has been conducted by means of the WinOSPM model. Concentration fields obtained from model simulations have been compared with experimental data of CO concentrations measured at two vertical locations within the canyon. The CFD results are in good agreement with the experimental data, while poor agreement is observed for the WinOSPM results. This is because WinOSPM was originally developed and tested for street canyons with aspect ratio H/W {$\allequal$} 1. Large discrepancies in wind profiles simulated within the canyon are observed between CFD and OSPM models. Therefore, a modification of the wind profile within the canyon is introduced in WinOSPM for extending its applicability to deeper canyons, leading to an improved agreement between modelled and experimental data. Further development of the operational dispersion model is required in order to reproduce the distinct air circulation patterns within deep street canyons.},

  abstract = {After almost 30 years of Federal retraction from anti-poverty initiatives, many American cities have been left with the dual burden of intensified poverty and far fewer resources to combat the problem. At the same time, such devolution has afforded cities the authority to forge poverty policy at the local level, such that the familiar neoliberal imperatives of state retraction and the mobilization of territory for capitalist expansion are frequently tempered by more progressive political imperatives at the local scale. What has thus emerged is a deeply ambivalent policy landscape, of which "kinder and gentler" poverty management strategies are a central feature. Using the example of a recent homeless program in San Francisco, "Care Not Cash", this paper argues that such poverty management strategies, while less punitive than their revanchist predecessors, nonetheless introduce a new set of exclusions to the service delivery system, many of which are obscured by the language of compassion. In order to illustrate those new exclusions, I describe the city's homeless geographies2014the public spaces, shelters, service sites, and housing models2014that have been produced and reconfigured according to a logic of managing homelessness through the provision of care.},

  abstract = {Bike share can improve the pedestrian experience, help reduce traffic fatalities, and reduce inequity in cities' transportation networks. To support cities across the country working towards all of these goals, NACTO has released the NACTO Bike Share Siting Guide, which highlights best practices in station placement and design. Bike share has rapidly emerged as a convenient, low-cost transportation option that can not only bolster public transit usage and increase cycling, but also address multiple street design needs simultaneously. Well-planned bike share stations can improve the pedestrian experience, help reduce traffic fatalities, and reduce inequity in cities' transportation networks. To support cities across the country working towards all of these goals, NACTO has released the NACTO Bike Share Siting Guide, which highlights best practices in station placement and design. Getting station placement right is integral to the success of a bike share system. Planners and community groups alike can use this new guidance to help design and advocate for better, easy-to-access bike share station locations and safer streets. Complete with photos from systems around North America, as well as helpful diagrams and clear technical illustrations, the Guide provides a framework for a new, evolving industry. Developed collaboratively with city transportation departments, bike share experts, planners, outreach specialists, system operators, and equipment vendors from a variety of North American cities, the techniques recommended by the Guide have been proven in real-world practice. The Guide provides concrete options for communities looking to increase mobility options and improve street safety in their neighborhoods. This key reference tool can be used to enhance the community engagement and outreach efforts that are essential to the planning of any bike share system. Getting bike share station placement right is good for more than just bike share users. As cities work to address decades-long issues of equity in street design (low-income people in particular have a disproportionate risk of death or injury caused by traffic crashes), effective bike share station placement and planning can help close the gap by increasing pedestrian visibility at intersections, providing pedestrian refuge areas, protecting bike lanes and pedestrian plazas, and extending the reach of transit. ``Location, location, location! Getting bike share station placement right propels success,'' said Seleta Reynolds, General Manager of the Los Angeles Department of Transportation and NACTO President. ``The new NACTO Bike Share Siting Guide helps cities learn from one another when it comes to station design and placement.'' ``Bike share doesn't plan itself,'' said Jim Kenney, Mayor of Philadelphia. ``From the community members who help choose the sites, to the planners and engineers who make sure they're safe, bike share is about sharing knowledge as much as it is about sharing bikes. The NACTO Bike Share Siting Guide is a playbook that features what we've learned here in Philadelphia and in our peer cities about making bike share work for our communities. We're proud to be an inspiration to other cities around the country.'' ``Vigorous community engagement is key to bike share success,'' said Tonnetta Graham, President of Strawberry Mansion Community Development Corporation. ``As shown in Philadelphia, having community members actively involved in station placement and design helped align the needs and goals of bike share and our community. Empower our concerned citizens and they will be ambassadors of bike share throughout the community.'' ``The new NACTO Bike Share Siting Guide is an excellent resource for cities as they plan their bike share systems. It is a targeted tool for bike share station placement and creating site drawings,'' said Bob Burns, President of B-Cycle. ``This guide provides clear discussion, great images and a variety of site drawings that clearly show how bike share equipment can be used to enhance the user experience in cities everywhere. B-Cycle is proud to recommend the NACTO Bike Share Siting Guide.'' ``We commend NACTO for its thorough research and comprehensive approach to this complex issue,'' said Jay Walder, President and CEO of Motivate. ``As the nation's largest bike share operator, Motivate works closely with cities on a wide variety of issues, including how and where to site bike share stations. The NACTO guide is a great resource and helps illustrate options used in cities across North America.'' ``NACTO's Bike Share Siting Guide is a highly useful resource for bike share planners and operators, providing clear standards for how and where to install bike share stations,'' said Nicole Freedman, President of the North American Bike Share Association (NABSA). ``This smart guidance will help cities create easily accessible bike share networks, and better streets for all. NABSA fully endorses the NACTO Bike Share Siting Guide.'' The Guide is a complement to NACTO's successful Urban Bikeway Design Guide and Urban Street Design Guide, which have set the bar for successful 21st-century multi-modal streets, as well as NACTO's Equity Practitioners' Paper series, which highlights best practices for cities aiming to address equity issues while introducing or expanding their bike share systems. The NACTO Bike Share Siting Guide is available in print and as a free download at nacto.org. The Guide is part of a collection of resources created in collaboration with the Better Bike Share Partnership. It is made possible by a grant from The JPB Foundation to further the conversation around equity in bike share.},

The model works by perturbing or offsetting the schedule such that the expected value of waiting times at all transfer points in the system is minimized. Probabilistic information on transfers is gathered from a prototypical journey planner, a public-facing tool that transit riders query to find optimal paths through a multimodal network. Aggregating journey plans in this manner provides information on optimal transfers as perceived by the service operator, which are then targeted for improvements. The model is implemented on the large-scale transit network of Washington, D.C., where sampled journey plans representing 9\% of the daily transit demand are used to generate a modified schedule that leads to a reduction in passenger wait times by 26.38\%. The results serve to demonstrate how operators can take a user-centric view of their system as a fabric of services, gain insights from user interaction, and achieve no-cost improvements from coordinating services while accounting for uncertainty.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT A quantitative analysis of the pioneering large-scale bicycle sharing system, V\'elib' in Paris, France is presented. This system involves a fleet of bicycles strategically located across the network. Users are free to check out a bicycle from close to their origin and drop it off close to their destination to complete their trip. The analysis provides key insights on the functioning of such systems and serves to inform policy makers in other urban communities wanting to explore bicycle-sharing systems. This article studies the V\'elib' system from several aspects, including system characteristics, utilization patterns, the connection between public transit and bicycle-sharing systems, and flow imbalances between stations. Since flow from one station to another is seldom matched by flows in the reverse direction, the bicycle fleet can become spatially imbalanced over time. This leads to lower levels of service for users who must seek alternate stations to park or check out vehicles. Using a stochastic characterization of demand and a model developed in prior work, fleet-management strategies to deal with this flow asymmetry are presented. Reliability metrics using this characterization show the performance of the system and help identify stations with capacity bottlenecks. Utilization rates also suggest that close coupling of transit and vehicle-sharing systems are beneficial.},

  abstract = {Public bicycle-sharing programmes (PBSPs) are experiencing enormous growth as an increasing number of cities worldwide are adopting the scheme. PBSPs are managed and operated by the private sector; by local community groups, including non-profit organisations (NPOs); and by local governments. In many Japanese cities where private bicycle sharing is high, the scale of PBSPs is relatively small, leading to challenges such as difficulty in securing funding and appointing operators. This paper proposes that NPOs may have the capacity to operate and effectively manage PBSPs in conjunction with other non-profit activities to promote community development. Using a case study approach and implementing a user perception survey, this study examines the experience of a small-scale, NPO-run PBSP in Kitakyushu City, Japan. Findings show that NPO management and operation added value to the PBSP. In addition, some users were interested in the PBSP beyond its role as a means of transport. These users tend to engage in local activities more frequently than other users. Finally, almost all of the users were satisfied with the bicycle-sharing service, regardless of their reasons for using the programme. The insights gained from these results may help improve small-scale PBSP implementation, policy, and planning, both in Japan and beyond.},

  abstract = {Carsharing (CS) has gained attention as a measure to reduce vehicle ownership, motivate multimodal mobility and cut greenhouse gases and other pollutants. Some municipalities have adopted specific regulations to support adoption of CS. Initial studies, reflecting outcomes from early adopters, have confirmed the expected effects of CS on reduced car ownership and GHG emissions associated with mobility. This study addresses three questions: a) are early adopters sensitive to one-way vs. two-way carsharing? b) do early and late adopters have different household characteristics? and c) can outcomes associated with early adopters be projected onto later adopters? Our study is based on a 2013 survey of residents in 110 apartment buildings in Metro Vancouver, Canada. 2011 responses were analyzed for possible differentiating factors for early adopters at the household level. We find that early adopters (24\% of respondents) have more wage-earners per household, live with fewer older family members in neighbourhoods with better CS access and own fewer cars. Among non-CS membership holders (76\% of respondents), roughly one-third stated they would never choose CS. The rest expressed interest in joining if CS accessibility was improved and usage/membership fees were lowered. These households are dissimilar to early adopters; they are more likely to live with elderly family members and to own automobile(s) while less likely to have multiple wage earners in their households. The specific characteristics and circumstances of early CS adopters mean that as CS memberships expand, the past patterns of vehicle utilization, car-shedding, vehicle kilometres travelled shifts, and greenhouse gas reductions may not be replicated. Further investigations are required before concluding that the long-term effects of CS services align with observed benefits to date.},

Worldwide, several hundred thousand people are currently contributing information to the ``free'' geodatabase. However, the data contributions show a geographically heterogeneous pattern around the globe. Germany counts as one of the most active countries in OSM; thus, the German street network has undergone an extensive development in recent years. The question that remains is this: How does the street network perform in a relative comparison with a commercial dataset? By means of a variety of studies, we show that the difference between the OSM street network for car navigation in Germany and a comparable proprietary dataset was only 9\% in June 2011. The results of our analysis regarding the entire street network showed that OSM even exceeds the information provided by the proprietary dataset by 27\%. Further analyses show on what scale errors can be reckoned with in the topology of the street network, and the completeness of turn restrictions and street name information. In addition to the analyses conducted over the past few years, projections have additionally been made about the point in time by which the OSM dataset for Germany can be considered ``complete'' in relative comparison to a commercial dataset.},

How has the region responded differently to the challenge of regional transit in the most recent wave of funding? What accounts for governance failure even when, at various points in the historical debate, local actors have been in agreement on a metro transit agenda? What has changed since the 1960s and ill these differences empower the metro region to finally establish metropolitan transit governance? Finally, what can the lessons of these two periods teach us about governing regional transit in fragmented political contexts? [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

There is an increasing focus on such transdisciplinary approaches in the scientific literature, teaching and program interventions. However, there is often skepticism and critique from researchers in established disciplines about the value of, and scientific basis for, transdisciplinary work. This chapter traces the emergence of transdisciplinary work from two perspectives: as a pragmatic approach to solving complex, or ``wicked'' problems, and as a reflection of newer theoretical views about ontology and epistemology.Since the mid-1900s, researchers from multiple disciplines and practitioners from many societal sectors have increasingly advocated for transdisciplinary approaches to understanding and addressing complex problems. In parallel, theoretical views of ontology have been changing from considering reality as a coherent whole with laws and linear origins to seeing reality as being made up of multiple, ever-changing dimensions. Newer views of ontology also catalyzed changes in views about scientific inquiry (epistemology), including the emergence of the design sciences\textemdash considered the third epistemological paradigm. Design science theory and methods focus on studying the participatory development, testing and improvement of human-created objects, services and environments. Although design sciences are most commonly used in architecture, engineering and other socio-technical fields, they provide invaluable guidance for all researchers and practitioners engaged in transdisciplinary work that addresses complex problems.},

  abstract = {In the past two decades urban time policies have been proposed and implemented in many European cities as a complement to traditional spatial planning methods. Such policies seek to provide an answer to the growing number of people facing time problems as a result of an erosion of collective time rhythms and a desynchronisation of different time structures of urban life. Particular emphasis is being placed on the reconciliation of opening hours of public service facilities with the travel and activity patterns of citizens in order to increase individual accessibility to urban services. In spite of the increasing relevance of time policies, only limited quantitative research has been conducted about the relationships between opening hours and accessibility. This paper seeks to extend this line of inquiry by exploring if and to what extent the accessibility of public facilities can be ameliorated by redesigning the timetables of service delivery. A method is proposed to optimise the temporal regime of public service delivery in terms of accessibility. The method is illustrated in a case study of accessibility of government offices within the city of Ghent (Belgium). Our findings suggest that by rescheduling the opening hours of public service facilities individual accessibility to service delivery can be improved significantly. Our study may support urban service deliverers, policymakers and urban planners in assessing timetables for a better 'accessible' service provision.},

  abstract = {Abstract Objective: Persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experience several physical and cognitive problems which can influence their travel behaviour. This study aimed to document the number of activities, the activity type and the transport mode of the related trips that are daily made by PwMS. Their outdoor activity and travel behaviour was studied in relation to disease-related disability. Methods: Thirty six PwMS (Expanded Disability Status Scale, EDSS, 1.5\textendash 8.0, age 27\textendash 63) and 24 healthy controls (age 25\textendash 62) were studied, using activity-related travel diaries and GPS tracking devices. Information about overall disability characteristics was gained by standard clinical tests and questionnaires. PwMS were further divided in three subgroups based on EDSS cut-off scores 4.5 and 6.5. Results: Persons with mild ambulatory dysfunction (EDSS 1.5\textendash 4.0, n\,=\,17) showed similar travel characteristics to healthy controls, with few restrictions during travelling. Statistically significant changes in activity and travel behaviour were detected in the moderate (EDSS 4.5\textendash 6.5, n\,=\,8) and severe MS subgroups (EDSS\,{$>$}\,6.5\textendash 8.0, n\,=\,11) compared with healthy controls: driving independently became less frequent, significant more trips were made with company and the duration of performed activities had increased. Conclusion: The combination of self-reported travel diaries and objective GPS loggers offered detailed information about the actual outdoor travel behaviour of PwMS, which was significantly changed in PwMS with EDSS greater than 4.Implications for Rehabilitation Activity and travel behaviour changes significantly in persons with multiple sclerosis (MS) with moderate to severe disability (EDSS greater than 4).Behavioural therapy could help to develop better coping and problem-solving skills to overcome anxiety in the making of trips by persons with MS with a mild severity.Enhancing community environments could serve as a promising approach to increase the outdoor participation of persons with (more severe) impairments.},

This paper aims to provide a state-of-the-art analysis of a selection of mobility initiatives that may dictate the future of urban transportation and make cities smarter. These are mechanisms either recently introduced with encouraging uptake so far and much greater potential to contribute in a shift to a better transport paradigm or still in an embryonic stage of their development and yet to be embraced as powerful mechanisms that could change travel behaviour norms. Autonomous and connected vehicles are set to revolutionise the urban landscape by allowing machines to take over driving that for over a century has been exclusively a human activity, while electrical vehicles are already helping decarbonising the transport sector. Bus rapid transit has been steadily reinventing and rebranding conventional bus services revitalising the use of the humblest form of public transport, while hyperloop is an entirely new, disruptive, and somewhat provocative, travel mode proposition based on the use of sealed tube systems through which pods could travel free of air resistance with speeds exceeding 1000 km/h. Shared use mobility mechanisms like car-sharing, ride-sharing, ride-sourcing and public bicycles can help establishing a culture for using mobility resources on an as-needed basis, while mobility-as-a-service will take this sharing culture a step further, offering tailored mobility and trip planning packages that could entirely replace the need for privately owned modes of transport.},

In either case, mean commute distances tend to increase. Telecommuting is seen as a means of increasing the jobs-housing balance in urban and suburban areas by enhancing the ability to move work to, or closer to, the workers' residences rather than requiring workers to commute to work daily. This has the immediate side effect of decreasing automobile congestion and associated energy consumption and air pollution. There is a possible longer term adverse impact of telecommuting resulting from its ability to decrease constraints on household location, thereby enhancing the rate of spread of suburbia. This paper reviews evidence concerning the possible effects of telecommuting on urban sprawl, as derived from a two-year test of telecommuting in California, and describes two scenarios of urban form development made more feasible by telecommuting.},

This paper extends the well-known spatial interaction model to the analysis of interregional and intraregional interactions. The Interregional Interaction Model explains the behavioral phenomena that we recognize as functional distance and functional regions, and calibration of the model amounts to their objective delimitation. Regionally biased interactions are simulated, and the embedded regional structure successfully recovered in a series of tests, even when substantial error components are introduced into the simulations. A heuristic calibration technique is developed for large problems. The heuristic is used to partition the United States into two functional regions, based on student migration matrices. A cluster of southeastern states consistently emerges as a functional region distinct from the north.},

  abstract = {lthough the fields of urban planning and public health share a common origin in the efforts of reformers to tame the ravages of early industrialization in the 19th century, the 2 disciplines parted ways in the early 20th century as planners increasingly focused on the built environment while public health professionals narrowed in on biomedical causes of disease and disability. Among the unfortunate results of this divergence was a tendency to discount the public health implications of planning decisions. Given increasingly complex urban environments and grave health disparities in cities worldwide, urban planners and public health professionals have once again become convinced of the need for inclusive approaches to improve population health and achieve health equity. To make substantive progress, intersectoral collaboration utilizing ecological and systems science perspectives will be crucial as the solutions lie well beyond the control of any single authority. Grounded in the social determinants of health, and with a renewed sense of interconnectedness, dedicated and talented people in government agencies and communities who recognize that our future depends on cultivating local change and evaluating the results can come to grips with the enormous challenge that lies ahead to create more equitable, sustainable, and healthier cities worldwide.},

Improvements in cycling infrastructure are associated with higher overall cycling rates, but less is known about bike lane utilization in low-income urban neighborhoods. Methods: During the summer of 2009, 4 Central Brooklyn streets with bicycle lanes were studied using camcorders to record for a total of 40 hours. Video recordings were coded for behaviors and characteristics of cyclists and motorists. An intercept survey (N = 324, 42\% participation rate) captured information on cyclist demographics, behaviors, and attitudes. Results: 1282 cyclists were observed on study streets. Cyclists were primarily male (80.0\%) and non-White (54.5\%). 9.9\% of motorists drove in the bike lane and parked vehicles blocked the bike lane for 9.6\% of the observational period. Of cyclists surveyed, 69.4\% lived locally, 61.3\% were normal weight or underweight, and 64.8\% met recommended levels of physical activity by cycling 30+ minutes/day on 5+ days of the past week. Conclusions: Bicycle lanes were used by local residents of a low-income urban neighborhood. Compared with neighborhood residents overall, cyclists reported better health and health behaviors. Enhancing infrastructure that supports active transportation may be effective in reducing health inequities in low-income urban communities.},

This paper explores this relationship, expanding on earlier publications, notably Capabilities and Human Rights (1997), Women and Human Development (2000), Capabilities as Fundamental Entitlements (2003), and Frontiers of Justice (2005). Capabilities are complementary to and augment, rather than competing with, human rights. Capabilities can supplement the language of rights in clarifying the basic concept of human rights, by emphasizing the material and social aspect of all rights and the need for government action to protect and secure all rights. They also ground entitlements in the lives of ordinary people, without tying them down to a specific cultural context. Human rights can also supplement the language of capabilities. Human rights makes clear that the idea of capabilities is not an optional entitlement, but an urgent demand that should not be ignored nor compromised in pursuit of other objectives such as expansion of aggregate wealth. Human rights have gained support and endorsement the world over, and the idea of rights has the capacity to mobilize political action.},

But I argue that capabilities can help us to construct a normative conception of social justice, with critical potential for gender issues, only if we specify a definite set of capabilities as the most important ones to protect. Sen's "perspective of freedom" is too vague. Some freedoms limit others; some freedoms are important, some trivial, some good, and some positively bad. Before the approach can offer a valuable normative gender perspective, we must make commitments about substance.},

If we rely on conventional economic indicators, can we ever grasp how the world's billions of individuals are really managing?In this powerful critique, Martha Nussbaum argues that our dominant theories of development have given us policies that ignore our most basic human needs for dignity and self-respect. For the past twenty-five years, Nussbaum has been working on an alternate model to assess human development: the Capabilities Approach. She and her colleagues begin with the simplest of questions: What is each person actually able to do and to be? What real opportunities are available to them? The Capabilities Approach to human progress has until now been expounded only in specialized works. Creating Capabilities, however, affords anyone interested in issues of human development a wonderfully lucid account of the structure and practical implications of an alternate model. It demonstrates a path to justice for both humans and nonhumans, weighs its relevance against other philosophical stances, and reveals the value of its universal guidelines even as it acknowledges cultural difference. In our era of unjustifiable inequity, Nussbaum shows how\textemdash by attending to the narratives of individuals and grasping the daily impact of policy\textemdash we can enable people everywhere to live full and creative lives.},

The concept of human security offers a new approach to the challenges of climate change, and the responses that could lead to a more equitable and sustainable future.

  abstract = {Bicycle sharing systems (bike-shares) are becoming increasingly popular in towns and cities around the world. They are viewed as a cheap, efficient, and healthy means of navigating dense urban environments. This paper is the first to take a global view of bike-sharing characteristics by analysing data from 38 systems located in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australasia and the Americas. To achieve this, an extensive database depicting the geographical location and bicycle occupancy of each docking station within a particular system has been created over a number of years to chart the usage in the chosen systems (and others) and provide a consistent basis on which to compare and classify them. Analysis of the variation of occupancy rates over time, and comparison across the system's extent, infers the likely demographics and intentions of user groups. A classification of bike-shares, based on the geographical footprint and diurnal, day-of-week and spatial variations in occupancy rates, is proposed. The knowledge of such patterns and characteristics identifiable from the dataset has a range of applications, including informing operators and policymakers about the maintenance of a suitable balance of bicycles throughout the system area (a nontrivial problem for many bike-shares), the location of new docking stations and cycle lanes, and better targeting of promotional materials to encourage new users. Within the context of transport research, the systems utilised here are part of relatively small, closed environments that can be more easily modelled and validated. Such work lays foundations for the analysis of larger scale transport systems by creating a classification of the different systems and seeks to demonstrate that bike-shares have a lot to offer both as an effective method of transport and a rich source of data.},

They offer an alternative to planner-driven land valuation, placing the valuation responsibility instead on stakeholders. The methodology is justified and explained. The authors introduce different types of decision-support information products that can be derived to facilitate consensus building. They summarise experience gained in an evaluation of the proposed methodological procedure, in which university students were used as a sample. They conclude that computing technology has advanced sufficiently to make it reasonably straightforward to collect information about individual stakeholders' land valuations, and that the resultant information can be packaged effectively in a collaborative spatial decision support system to facilitate consensus building.

We sought to characterize high-risk adults' knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, prevention strategies, and prevention behaviors. We used data from the Chicago COVID-19 Comorbidities (C3) survey collected between March 13 thru March 20, 2020. A total of 673 predominately older adults with\,{$\geq$}\,1 chronic condition completed the telephone interview. Knowledge was assessed by asking participants to name three symptoms of COVID-19 and three actions to prevent infection. Participants were then asked if and how they had changed plans due to coronavirus. Most participants could identify three symptoms (71.0\%) and three preventive actions (69.2\%). Commonly reported symptoms included: fever (78.5\%), cough (70.6\%), and shortness of breath (45.2\%); preventive actions included: washing hands (86.5\%) and social distancing (86.2\%). More than a third of participants reported social distancing themselves (38.3\%), and 28.8\% reported obtaining prescription medication to prepare for the outbreak. In multivariable analyses, no participant characteristics were associated with COVID-19 knowledge. Women were more likely than men, and Black adults were less likely than White adults to report practicing social distancing. Individuals with low health literacy were less likely to report obtaining medication supplies. In conclusion, though most higher-risk individuals were aware of social distancing as a prevention strategy early in the outbreak, less than half reported enacting it, and racial disparities were apparent. Consistent messaging and the provision of tangible resources may improve future adherence to safety recommendations.},

Case studies from around the country clearly show how to implement best practices, as well as provide guidance for customizing design applications to a city's unique needs.~ Urban Street Design Guide outlines five goals and tenets of world-class street design:\textbullet ~~~ Streets are public spaces. Streets play a much larger role in the public life of cities and communities than just thoroughfares for traffic.\textbullet ~~~ Great streets are great for business. Well-designed streets generate higher revenues for businesses and higher values for homeowners.\textbullet ~~~ Design for safety. Traffic engineers can and should design streets where people walking, parking, shopping, bicycling, working, and driving can cross paths safely.\textbullet ~~~ Streets can be changed. Transportation engineers can work flexibly within the building envelope of a street. Many city streets were created in a different era and need to be reconfigured to meet new needs.\textbullet ~~~ Act now! Implement projects quickly using temporary materials to help inform public decision making.Elaborating on these fundamental principles, the guide offers substantive direction for cities seeking to improve street design to create more inclusive, multi-modal urban environments.~ It is an exceptional resource for redesigning streets to serve the needs of 21st century cities, whose residents and visitors demand a variety of transportation options, safer streets, and vibrant community life.},

We sought to examine inequalities in uptake and usage of London's Barclays Cycle Hire (BCH) scheme. Method We obtained complete BCH registration data, and compared users with the general population. We examined usage levels by explanatory variables including gender, small-area income-deprivation and local cycling prevalence. Results 100,801 registered individuals made 2.5 million trips between July 2010 and March 2011. Compared with residents and workers in the central London area served by the scheme, registered individuals were more likely to be male and to live in areas of low deprivation and high cycling prevalence. Among those registered, females made 1.63 (95\%CI 1.53, 1.74) fewer trips per month than males, and made under a fifth of all trips. Adjusting for the fact that deprived areas were less likely to be close to BCH docking stations, users in the most deprived areas made 0.85 (95\%CI 0.63,1.07) more trips per month than those in the least deprived areas. Conclusion Females and residents in deprived areas are underrepresented among users of London's public bicycle sharing scheme. The scheme's planned expansion into more deprived areas has, however, the potential to create a more equitable uptake of cycling.},

The purpose of this research is to test for and explore spatial variation in the relationship between socio-economic and green vegetation land cover across urban, suburban, and rural areas, using geographically weighted regression (GWR). The analysis was conducted at the census block group level for Massachusetts, using Census 2000 data and impervious surface data at 1-m resolution. To explore regional variations in the relationship, four scenarios were generated by regressing each of the following socio-economic variables \textendash{} median household income, percentage of poverty, percentage of minority population, and median home value \textendash{} against two environmental variables \textendash{} percent of impervious surface and population density. GWR results show that there is a considerable spatial variation in the character and the strength of the relationship for each model. There are two main conclusions in this study. First, the impervious surface is generally a strong predictor of the level of wealth as measured by four variables included in the analysis, at the scale of census block group; however, the strength of the relationship varies geographically. Second, GWR, not ordinary least squares technique, should be used for regional scale spatial analysis because it is able to account for local effects and shows geographical variation in the strength of the relationship.

Growth controls (land use regulations that attempt to restrict population growth and urban sprawl) have increased housing prices and diverted population growth to uncontrolled cities. It has been suggested that resulting changes in local labour supply might stimulate intercity commuting from uncontrolled to controlled cities. To test this hypothesis, a gravity model of commuting flows between places in California is estimated using alternative econometric methods (OLS, Heckman selection and count-data). The possibility of spatial dependence in commuting flows is also taken into consideration. Results suggest larger commuting flows to destination places that restrict residential growth.},

Various attempts to define and justify critical thought without such a conception are shown to be deficient, and incapable of distinguishing oppression from well-being. Objections that such a project will be subjective, ethnocentric, essentialist and implicitly authoritarian are discussed and rejected. Normative thinking needs to go beyond liberal concern with freedom, to address what Sen and Nussbaum term "capabilities"2014the range of things people need to be able to have and do to flourish. The power of this kind of normative thinking is illustrated by reference to examples from development studies. The paper concludes with some basic questions for radical geographers.},

Instead, they find that a combination of high levels of racial segregation followed by interracial contact generates racial competition, which in turn increases the rate of ethnic and racial unrest. The results show that in SMSAs where residential contact between African Americans and Whites increases, the rate of race riots increases significantly.

It contains information on the daily mobility (e.g., from home to work) of individuals who either live or work in Luxembourg. We extracted individual characteristics to relate daily movements (journeys between home and work, in particular) to the characteristics of working individuals. We used the information about public transportation and some geographical location of the residential and work places. We compare the rates of successful prediction obtained by neural networks and several alternative approaches for predicting the travel mode choice using cross-validation. The results show that the artificial neural networks perform better compared to other alternatives. Our analysis can be used to support management decision-making and build predictions under uncertainty related to changes in people's behavior, economic context or environment and transportation infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Welfare recipients face a number of obstacles to making the transition from welfare to work. One is their geographical separation from employment opportunities: many welfare recipients live in 'job-poor' neighbourhoods far from employment for which they are qualified. Combining administrative data on welfare recipients and employment in Los Angeles with data from the 1990 decennial census, we show that greater access to local jobs in low-wage firms increases the likelihood that welfare recipients find employment in neighbourhood jobs. Moreover, welfare recipients who have long commutes earn less than those who find work closer to home, contrary to the pattern for most workers. These findings demonstrate that proximity to low-wage jobs benefits welfare recipients through reduced commuting expenses and increased earnings.},

  abstract = {OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. The creation and growth of OSM has been motivated by restrictions on use or availability of map information across much of the world, and the advent of inexpensive portable satellite navigation devices. OSM is considered a prominent example of volunteered geographic information. Created by Steve Coast in the UK in 2004, it was inspired by the success of Wikipedia and the predominance of proprietary map data in the UK and elsewhere. Since then, it has grown to over 2 million registered users, who can collect data using manual survey, GPS devices, aerial photography, and other free sources. These crowdsourced data are then made available under the Open Database Licence. The site is supported by the OpenStreetMap Foundation, a non-profit organisation registered in England and Wales. Rather than the map itself, the data generated by the OpenStreetMap project are considered its primary output. The data are then available for use in both traditional applications, like its usage by Craigslist, OsmAnd, Geocaching, MapQuest Open, JMP statistical software, and Foursquare to replace Google Maps, and more unusual roles like replacing default data included with GPS receivers. OpenStreetMap data have been favourably compared with proprietary datasources, though data quality varies worldwide.},

It draws on a case study of the dublinbikes scheme and was guided by the Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) conceptual framework. The study employed a mixed method data collection approach encompassing interviews with key informants and users (and non-users) of the PBSS and analyses of statutory plans, policy documents, engineering guidance and other material. Through an examination of a number of domains \textemdash{} rules and regulations, user experiences of navigating the city, the emergence of new actors and re-alignments of existing relationships, infrastructures and traffic management measures \textemdash{} it is revealed that the introduction of the PBSS set in motion an array of unpredicted processes and cascade effects (or feedback loops in complex systems terms) which are now playing out. The knowledge generated from this study of the planning and early operational phases of the new socio-technical system enhances our understandings of processes of change associated with PBSSs and, more broadly, of some potential transition pathways towards lower carbon futures. The paper also raises new questions for future research.},

While this has helped consolidate an emerging body of theory concerned with the social consequences of mobility, our understanding of these dynamics in the context of high vulnerability and poverty in the Global South is still relatively undeveloped. Through the case of Soacha, a municipality adjacent to Colombia's capital, Bogot\'a, this paper explores travel strategies in a context of scarce provision of transport which, when combined with acute conditions of low-income and segregation, limit vulnerable populations' access to the city. The travel practices, perceptions and priorities of low-income populations in deprived areas of the Global South are analysed, using a framework of transport-related social exclusion, to critically examine the elements that play a role in gaining access to the city. The emergence of adaptable methods, relations and transactions between demand and supply that allows deprived populations to reduce their risk of becoming socially excluded show potential for conceptual and practical development in addressing and analysing transport-related social exclusion.},

Hybrid cars, fast trains, compact florescent light bulbs, solar  panels, carbon offsets: Everything you've been told about living green is  wrong. The quest for a breakthrough battery or a 100 mpg car are  dangerous fantasies. We are consumers, and we like to consume green and  efficiently. But David Owen argues that our best intentions are still at  cross purposes to our true goal - living sustainably and caring for our  environment and the future of the planet. Efficiency, once considered the  holy grail of our environmental problems, turns out to be part of the  problem. Efforts to improve efficiency and increase sustainable  development only exacerbate the problems they are meant to solve, more  than negating the environmental gains. We have little trouble turning  increases in efficiency into increases in consumption.David Owen's The Conundrum is an elegant nonfiction narrative  filled with fascinating information and anecdotes takes you through the  history of energy and the quest for efficiency. This is a book about the  environment that will change how you look at the world. We should not be  waiting for some geniuses to invent our way out of the energy and  economic crisis we're in. We already have the technology and knowledge we  need to live sustainably. But will we do it?That is the conundrum.},

Past research on neighborhood upgrading tends to focus on one process: gentrification. I argue that a broader range of types of neighborhood socioeconomic ascent requires examination. This article documents the different types of neighborhoods ascending from 1970 to the present. Using principal components analysis and cluster analysis, I report the prevalence of socioeconomic ascent, based on increases in neighborhood income, rents, house values, and educational and occupational attainment, among five to seven types of neighborhoods in each decade. I also examine population and housing changes that co-occur with ascent to identify processes of ascent beyond gentrification. Overall, findings suggest mixed implications for neighborhood inequality. While white suburban neighborhoods make up the bulk of neighborhoods that ascend in each decade, minority and immigrant neighborhoods become increasingly likely to ascend over time, though displacement may occur.},

  abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed a growing trend towards transit-oriented development (TOD) as a critical approach for achieving sustainable mobility. However, some analysts and community activists have expressed concerns that TOD could induce gentrification and potential concomitant low-income group displacements. This paper presents a systematic review of 35 quantitative research-based studies presenting evidence on gentrification outcomes resulting from transit-based interventions, published between 2000 and 2018. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review on this topic and thus provides a useful synthesis of current empirical evidence on transit-induced gentrification. Although there is some evidence supporting the transit-induced gentrification hypothesis, methodological flaws render many of the studies' conclusions highly questionable. The findings suggest that gentrification is more closely associated with existing local dynamics, built environment attributes, and accompanying policies than transit-oriented development. In its critical analysis of research approaches, this paper warns that the incorporation of several sources of bias into study designs may engender a number of misinterpretations, thus ultimately leading to misguided conclusions and policies.},

Local communities exacerbate these problems through exclusionary zoning. We study the impact of the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) change in allocation formula under California's affordable housing mandate. The old policy followed a fair share strategy, whereas the new policy requires local jurisdictions to locate mandated affordable housing units in jobs-rich areas. We compare affordable housing produced in the region before and after ABAG adopted the jobs-housing policy; we also compare the new patterns to the location of market-rate housing and to the experiences of San Diego (CA) and Los Angeles (CA), both of which retain fair share allocation. We do not control for variables that may have affected affordable housing location. ABAG's policy shift is associated with a 104\% improvement in the balance of housing and jobs at the local level; affordable housing units are more likely than market-rate housing to locate in jobs-rich areas, which may indicate that localities prioritize affordable housing. We also find that more affordable housing locates in such areas in the San Francisco Bay Area (CA) than in San Diego or Los Angeles.Takeaway for practice: A voluntary regional government in a state with mandatory affordable housing requirements can affect the production and distribution of affordable housing. A total of 25 U.S. states require localities to include affordable housing elements in their comprehensive plans; we suggest that regional and local planners use these opportunities to meet multiple policy goals by directing affordable housing to jobs-rich neighborhoods.},

This systematic review seeks to review the empirical literature on temporary population estimation and identify the contemporary ``state of the art''. We identify a total of 96 studies that attempt to estimate or describe a method of estimation. Our findings reveal strong growth in the number of studies in recent decades that in part has been driven by the rise in both the type and availability of new sources of information, including mobile phone data. What emerges from this systematic review is the lack of any ``gold standard'' data source or methodology for temporary population estimation. The review points to a number of important challenges that remain for estimating temporary populations, both conceptually and practically. What remains is the need for clear definitions along with identification of appropriate data and methods that are able to robustly capture and measure the diverse array of spatial behaviours that drive temporary population dynamics. To our knowledge, this is the first review on this topic that brings together literature from various disciplines and collates methods used for estimation.},

Throughout this decline, however, violent crime continued to concentrate in socially and economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods. Using detailed homicide records from 1990 to 2010, this study examines the spatial patterning of violent crime in Chicago to determine whether or not all neighborhoods experienced decreases in violence. We find that while in absolute terms nearly all neighborhoods in the city benefited from reductions in homicide, relative inequality in crime between the city's safest and most dangerous neighborhoods actually increased by 10 percent. This increase was driven by a greater rate of decline in the city's safest neighborhoods. This crime gap can be partly attributed to the decreasing association between concentrated disadvantage and homicide in the safest neighborhoods. We also find that the decline did not significantly alter the spatial distribution of crime, as homicides remained concentrated in the initially most dangerous neighborhoods and their adjacent areas.},

A vulnerability index based on building characteristics (indicators) rather than empirical data may be an alternative approach to a comprehensive physical vulnerability assessment of the building stock. The present paper focuses on the making of such an index for dynamic flooding in mountain areas demonstrating the transferability of vulnerability assessment approaches between hazard types, reducing the amount of required data and offering a tool that can be used in areas were empirical data are not available. We use data from systematically documented torrential events in the European Alps to select and weight the important indicators using an all-relevant feature selection algorithm based on random forests. The permutation-based feature selection reduced the initial number of indicators from 22 to seven, decreasing in this way the amount of required data for assessing physical vulnerability and ensuring that only relevant indicators are considered. The new Physical Vulnerability Index (PVI) may be used in the mountain areas of Europe and beyond where only few empirical data are available supporting decision-making in reducing risk to dynamic flooding.},

  abstract = {Since the mid-2000s, public bikesharing (also known as ``bike hire'') has developed and spread into a new form of mobility in cities across the globe. This paper presents an analysis of the recent increase in the number of public bikesharing systems. Bikesharing is the shared use of a bicycle fleet, which is accessible to the public and serves as a form of public transportation. The initial system designs were pioneered in Europe and, after a series of technological innovations, appear to have matured into a system experiencing widespread adoption. There are also signs that the policy of public bikesharing systems is transferable and is being adopted in other contexts outside Europe. In public policy, the technologies that are transferred can be policies, technologies, ideals or systems. This paper seeks to describe the nature of these systems, how they have spread in time and space, how they have matured in different contexts, and why they have been adopted. Researchers provide an analysis from Europe and North America. The analysis draws on published data sources, a survey of 19 systems, and interviews with 12 decision-makers in Europe and 14 decision-makers in North America. The data are examined through the lens of diffusion theory, which allows for comparison of the adoption process in different contexts. A mixture of quantitative and qualitative analyses is used to explore the reasons for adoption decisions in different cities. The paper concludes that Europe is still in a major adoption process with new systems emerging and growth in some existing systems, although some geographic areas have adopted alternative solutions. Private sector operators have also been important entrepreneurs in a European context, which has accelerated the uptake of these systems. In North America, the adoption process is at an earlier stage and is gaining momentum, but signs also suggest the growing importance of entrepreneurs in North America with respect to technology and business models. There is evidence to suggest that the policy adoption processes have been inspired by successful systems in Paris, Lyon, Montreal, and Washington, DC, for instance, and that diffusion theory could be useful in understanding public bikesharing policy adoption in a global context.},

A number of previous studies have exploited existing disaggregate data sets. This study uses UK 2001 census data, is based on a logistic regression model and provides complementary evidence based on aggregate data for the determinants of cycle choice. It suggests a saturation level for bicycle use of 43\%. Smaller proportions cycle in wards with more females and higher car ownership. The physical condition of the highway, rainfall and temperature each have an effect on the proportion that cycles to work, but the most significant physical variable is hilliness. The proportion of bicycle route that is off-road is shown to be significant, although it displays a low elasticity (+0.049) and this contrasts with more significant changes usually forecast by models constructed from stated preference based data. Forecasting shows the trend in car ownership has a significant effect on cycle use and offsets the positive effect of the provision of off-road routes for cycle traffic but only in districts that are moderately hilly or hilly. The provision of infrastructure alone appears insufficient to engender higher levels of cycling.},

  abstract = {Background Recent work in a number of countries has identified growing geographical inequalities in health between deprived and non-deprived neighbourhoods. The health gaps observed cannot be entirely explained by differences in the characteristics of individuals living in those neighbourhoods, which has led to a concerted international public health research effort to determine what contextual features of neighbourhoods matter. This article reports on access to potentially health-promoting community resources across all neighbourhoods in New Zealand. Prevailing international opinion is that access to community resources is worse in deprived neighbourhoods. Methods Geographical Information Systems were used to calculate geographical access to 16 types of community resources (including recreational amenities, and shopping, educational and health facilities) in 38 350 small census areas across the country. The distribution of these access measures by neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation was determined. Results For 15 out of 16 measures of community resources, access was clearly better in more deprived neighbourhoods. For example, the travel time to large supermarkets was [\textasciitilde ]80\% greater in the least deprived quintile of neighbourhoods compared with the most deprived quintile. Conclusions These results challenge the widely held, but largely untested, view that areas of high social disadvantage have poorer access to community resources. Poor locational access to community resources among deprived neighbourhoods in New Zealand does not appear to be an explanation of poorer health in these neighbourhoods. If anything, a pro-equity distribution of community resources may be preventing even wider disparities in neighbourhood inequalities in health.}

We examine the association between neighbourhood accessibility to supermarkets and convenience stores and individuals' consumption of fruit and vegetables in New Zealand. MethodsUsing geographical information systems, travel times from the population-weighted centroid of each neighbourhood to the closest supermarket and convenience store were calculated for 38 350 neighbourhoods. These neighbourhood measures of accessibility were appended to the 2002-3 New Zealand Health Survey of 12 529 adults. ResultsThe consumption of the recommended daily intake of fruit was not associated with living in a neighbourhood with better access to supermarkets or convenience stores. Similarly, access to supermarkets was not related to vegetable intake. However, individuals in the quartile of neighbourhoods with the best access to convenience stores had 25\% (OR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.60\% to 0.93\%) lower odds of eating the recommended vegetable intake compared to individuals in the base category (worst access). ConclusionThis study found little evidence that poor locational access to food retail provision is associated with lower fruit and vegetable consumption. However, before rejecting the commonsense notion that neighbourhood access to fruit and vegetables affects personal consumption, research that measures fruit and vegetable access more precisely and directly is required.}

Depending on the disability measure used, annual poverty rates are 2 to 5 times higher among people with disabilities compared to those without disabilities. The relative long-term poverty rates among those with disabilities are much higher than the relative short-term poverty rates. People with disabilities represented 47\% of those in poverty in 1997 according to an annual measure of poverty and 65\% of those in poverty according to a long-term measure. The reasons that disability receives little attention in the poverty literature may be that most statistics are based on short-term measures, which partially mask the strong relationship between long-term poverty and long-term disability, and outdated perceptions of the relationship between disability and the ability to work.},

A dynamic buffering process in GIS is developed to measure the jobs-housing ratio within floating catchment areas of a 5-7 mile (8.05-11.27 km) radius as opposed to pre-defined and arbitrary jurisdictional boundaries. This study found a non-linear relationship between the jobs-housing ratio and VMT and trip length in the Portland, Oregon, metropolitan area. Only when the jobs-housing ratio is less than 1.2 or larger than 2.8 do VMT vary noticeably as the jobs-housing ratio changes. Marginal changes in VMT are small when the jobs-housing ratio is between 1.2 and 2.8. Since most areas in the study region have a job-household ratio between 1.2 and 2.8, any changes in the jobs-housing ratio will have little impact on VMT. Consequently, hardly any land use policy changes could affect the jobs-housing ratio enough to produce a significant change in VMT per capita, and jobs-housing policy will have limited impact on VMT at the regional level.},

This article opens with an overview of health equity and social determinants of health. It then proposes a set of recommended practices in measurement of health disparities, health inequities, and social determinants of health at the national level to support the advancement of health equity, highlighting that (1) differences in health and its determinants that are associated with social position are important to assess; (2) social and structural determinants of health should be assessed and multiple levels of measurement should be considered; (3) the rationale for methodological choices made and measures chosen should be made explicit; (4) groups to be compared should be simultaneously classified by multiple social statuses; and (5) stakeholders and their communication needs can often be considered in the selection of analytic methods. Although much is understood about the role of social determinants of health in shaping the health of populations, researchers should continue to advance understanding of the pathways through which they operate on particular health outcomes. There is still much to learn and implement about how to measure health disparities, health inequities, and social determinants of health at the national level, and the challenges of health equity persist. We anticipate that the present discussion will contribute to the laying of a foundation for standard practice in the monitoring of national progress toward achievement of health equity.},

  abstract = {Abstract Spatial planning has been earmarked as an important tool for achieving sustainable development. In Sweden the important task of planning for sustainable spatial development and land use falls largely to the local authorities, since there is no official institute for spatial planning at a national or regional level. This article investigates local planning for sustainable development by analysing recent municipal comprehensive plans, which it is argued are a major instrument for this purpose. Although comprehensive plans are statutory, their design and content is very much at local discretion, and for the most part, not a rigid process governed from above. For this reason, a template analysis was used, where the template was built from the contents of the comprehensive plans, and not from a predefined understanding of what sustainability is or how planning for sustainable development should be done. What the findings reveal, however, is that there is not much deliberation concerning the meaning(s) of sustainable development, and, further, that the planning principles considered necessary to bring about sustainable development were not exclusively regarded as sustainable as such, but rather as part of a general `belief system' about prudent planning\textemdash sustainable or not. It is suggested that, rather than rethinking planning, planners have internalized the concept of sustainable planning into the existing `belief system,' and thus, the planning principles have become `sustainable' by default.},

  abstract = {What factors determine the ridership of micro-mobility systems such as bikesharing or scooter sharing? This paper presents a case study on bikesharing in Seattle, USA, which has the distinction of being both one of the few cities in the world where a modern public bikesharing system (named Pronto in Seattle) has been shut down, and the first US city to permit dockless bikesharing operations. These dockless services produced more bikesharing trips in four months than Pronto did in its entire two-and-a-half-year run, and in their first year 11 times more rides than Pronto had in its first year. The contrast in performance between these two systems provides a unique opportunity to test alternative theories for why Pronto's ridership struggled where others have succeeded, offering more general insights into how system designers and regulators can avoid repeating the pitfalls of Seattle's original bikesharing launch. This case study triangulates qualitatively between popular press reports, interviews with key stakeholders, an original survey of bikesharing users, and ridership data from multiple bikesharing systems to evaluate the contributions of eleven factors to Pronto's low ridership. It concludes that the most important reasons for Pronto's struggles were inadequate system scale, station density, geographic coverage area, ease of use, and pricing structure. Critically, these factors all represent explicit choices made by system designers and policymakers, rather than local market or environmental factors beyond their control. The higher ridership of dockless bikesharing in Seattle appears primarily due to differences in these factors, which are not necessarily exclusive to dockless services. The paper closes with a discussion of how policymakers can avoid condemning emerging micro-mobility services to Pronto's fate of low ridership.},

A comparison is made of two concepts central to transport infrastructure planning in Sweden; Regional expansion and Environmentally sound transport. These concepts signify different perspectives on the benefits and problems with transport. The analysis explains how these clashing perspectives are resolved in the planning process. A discourse theoretical framework is applied to analyse the interplay between the concepts, the framings of problems and solutions, knowledge production practices and the outcomes of the planning process. The main finding is that the growth paradigm, captured in the concept of Regional expansion, has a strong influence on the planning discourse and restricts environmental policy options. The existing planning practices are mainly supporting the growth paradigm and contribute to an emphasis on certain problems and issues e.g. lack of capacity in the transport system and commuting trips. This results in other possible options e.g. reducing road transport volumes, or addressing leisure and service related travel, being excluded from the planning discourse. A number of consequences for the outcome of the planning process are discussed and possible ways of reframing problems are suggested.},

Evidence continues to emerge, linking the disproportion of contagion and mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), a result of adverse social determinants of health. Yet, genetic predisposition may also play a credible role in disease transmission. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells by interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the receptor molecule angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed on the surface of the target cells, such that polymorphisms and the expression level of ACE2 influence infectivity and consequent pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Genetic polymorphisms in other multiple genes, such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and interleukin-6, are also closely associated with underlying diseases, such as hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which substantially raise SARS-CoV-2 mortality. However, it is unknown how these genetic polymorphisms contribute to the disparate mortality rates, with or without underlying diseases. Of particular interest is the potential that genetic polymorphisms in these genes may be influencing the disparity of COVID-19 mortality rates in Black communities. Here, we review the evidence that biological predisposition for high-risk comorbid conditions may be relevant to our ability to fully understand and therefore address health disparities of COVID-19 deaths in Blacks.},

This research tests whether web-based engagement can forward equitable planning outcomes by examining proposed bikeshare station locations collected via a webapplication; operationalizing equity as equal access to bikeshare station locations across all populations. Results indicate that solely relying upon online outreach would lead to an inequitable distribution of station locations. Suggested station locations are negatively-correlated with increased minority populations and positively-correlated with an increased mix of employment and housing. As such, we determine that while online outreach is a convenient and efficient means of collecting vast amounts of information, on its own it is not well-suited to planning applications in which access-equity is a primary concern.},

This research suggests that for a substantial population of travelers who are interested in bicycling but unwilling to cycle regularly, barriers to increasing commute cycling may be different than for individuals who already commute by bicycle at least occasionally. Treating these two populations as one homogenous group may be inappropriate and reduce the effectiveness of bicycle promotion strategies. This research disaggregates these two prospective commute-cyclist populations and tests how attitudes, socio-demographics, and the built environment impact their commute mode choice. Socio-demographic and attitudinal data are drawn from a survey of ``Bike to Work Day'' participants in Denver, Colorado while built environment measures \textendash{} including street network connectivity, street network density, and trip distance \textendash{} were calculated with GIS. Bicycle commuting decisions within the two groups of prospective cyclists are estimated using binary and ordered logistic regression. Distinct socio-demographic and built environment factors are significant for different groups of prospective cyclists. Significant attitudinal variables are similar across groups; for both populations, convenience and utility of the bicycle relative to other modes is significant, suggesting that these factors outweigh issues regarding safety for the sample population. Findings from this research demonstrate that there are important distinctions between the decision to start commuting by bicycle and the decision to increase the frequency of bicycling to work.},

Based on this review, we find: a recent increase in the number of applications of this theory; that these applications appear across a wide range of outlets, relate to numerous policy domains, and are conducted by a diverse group of domestic and international scholars; that the target population proposition has been applied with greater frequency than the theory's feed-forward proposition; and that scholars have a notable interest in understanding causal mechanisms leading to changes in the positioning of target populations among advantaged, contender, dependent, and deviant target population categories. Following a descriptive review of past publications, we offer specific suggestions for theoretical development and future research.},

The problems surrounding this influx of people - slums, poverty, unemployment and lack of governance - have been well-documented.This book is a powerful indictment of the current consensus on how to deal with these challenges.  Pieterse argues that the current 'shelter for all' and 'urban good governance' policies treat only the symptoms, not the causes of the problem.  Instead, he claims, there is an urgent need to reinvigorate civil society in these cities, to encourage radical democracy, economic resilience, social resistance and environmental sustainability folded into the everyday concerns of marginalised people.

  abstract = {Travel demand management (TDM) consists of a variety of policy measures that affect the effectiveness of transportation systems by changing travel behavior. The primary objective of such TDM strategies is not to improve traffic safety, although their impact on traffic safety should not be neglected. The main purpose of this study is to simulate the traffic safety impact of conducting a teleworking scenario (i.e. 5\% of the working population engages in teleworking) in the study area, Flanders, Belgium. Since TDM strategies are usually conducted at a geographically aggregated level, crash prediction models should also be developed at an aggregate level. Given that crash occurrences are often spatially heterogeneous and are affected by many spatial variables, the existence of spatial correlation in the data is also examined. The results indicate the necessity of accounting for the spatial correlation when developing crash prediction models. Therefore, zonal crash prediction models (ZCPMs) within the geographically weighted generalized linear modeling framework are developed to incorporate the spatial variations in association between the number of crashes (including fatal, severe and slight injury crashes recorded between 2004 and 2007) and other explanatory variables. Different exposure, network and socio-demographic variables of 2200 traffic analysis zones (TAZs) are considered as predictors of crashes. An activity-based transportation model framework is adopted to produce detailed exposure metrics. This enables to conduct a more detailed and reliable assessment while TDM strategies are inherently modeled in the activity-based models. In this study, several ZCPMs with different severity levels and crash types are developed to predict crash counts for both the null and the teleworking scenario. The results show a considerable traffic safety benefit of conducting the teleworking scenario due to its impact on the reduction of total vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) by 3.15\%. Implementing the teleworking scenario is predicted to reduce the annual VKT by 1.43 billion and the total number of crashes to decline by 2.6\%.},

Over lunch, the four talked about the Chicago Housing Authority construction program. All the new public housing, it seemed, was going into black neighborhoods. If discrimination was prohibited in public schools, wasn't it also prohibited in public housing?And so began Gautreaux v. CHA and HUD, a case that from its rocky beginnings would roll on year after year, decade after decade, carrying Polikoff and his colleagues to the nation's Supreme Court (to face then-solicitor general Robert Bork); establishing precedents for suits against the discriminatory policies of local housing authorities, often abetted by HUD; and setting the stage for a nationwide experiment aimed at ending the concentration--and racialization--of poverty through public housing. Sometimes Kafkaesque, sometimes simply inspiring, and never less than absorbing, the story of Gautreaux, told by its principal lawyer, moves with ease through local and national civil rights history, legal details, political matters, and the personal costs--and rewards--of a commitment to fairness, equality, and justice. Both the memoir of a dedicated lawyer, and the narrative of a tenacious pursuit of equality, this story--itself a critical, still-unfolding chapter in recent American history--urges us to take an essential step in ending the racial inequality that Alexis de Toqueville prophetically named America's "most formidable evil."},

Using a unique data set gathered through a survey of mid-sized U.S. cities in 2015, this article examines patterns in food scrap management at the municipal level. Specifically, it studies the extent to which there are shared characteristics among those places most likely to develop municipal capacity for food scrap diversion, and how these patterns can inform policy makers eager to migrate to more sustainable materials management at the local level. We utilize a logistic regression model to test the relationships between two types of food scrap diversion capacities and both socio-economic and municipal waste system characteristics. We find that socio-economic characteristics have limited correlation with the presence of food scrap programming in general in mid-sized cities. Cities with yard waste collection and unit-pricing, on the other hand, are more likely to also have any food scrap diversion programs. We find further that, in mid-sized cities, population density is positively correlated with the curbside collection of food scraps, as is the presence of unit-pricing, while cities that have retained source-separated curbside recycling programs are less likely to have curbside food scrap collection.},

It is concerned with community systems\textemdash such as land use, housing, transportation, the environment, and the econ-omy\textemdash and their interconnections. The food system, however, is notable by its absence from most planning practice, research, and education. We present evidence for the limited presence of the food system in planning's list of concerns by scanning leading journals, texts, and classic writings, and by reporting on a survey of 22 U.S. city planning agencies. We analyze this low level of attention and discuss reasons and ideas for planning involvement to strengthen community food systems.1},

Despite its low visibility, the urban food system nonetheless contributes significantly to community health and welfare; to metropolitan economies; connects to other urban systems such as housing, transportation, land use, and economic development; and impacts the urban environment. We examine existing or potential city institutions that could offer a more comprehensive look at the urban food system.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increases in physical activity through active travel have the potential to have large beneficial effects on populations, through both better health outcomes and reduced motorized traffic. However accurately identifying travel mode in large datasets is problematic. Here we provide an open source tool to quantify time spent stationary and in four travel modes(walking, cycling, train, motorised vehicle) from accelerometer measured physical activity data, combined with GPS and GIS data. METHODS: The Examining Neighbourhood Activities in Built Living Environments in London study evaluates the effect of the built environment on health behaviours, including physical activity. Participants wore accelerometers and GPS receivers on the hip for 7 days. We time-matched accelerometer and GPS, and then extracted data from the commutes of 326 adult participants, using stated commute times and modes, which were manually checked to confirm stated travel mode. This yielded examples of five travel modes: walking, cycling, motorised vehicle, train and stationary. We used this example data to train a gradient boosted tree, a form of supervised machine learning algorithm, on each data point (131,537 points), rather than on journeys. Accuracy during training was assessed using five-fold cross-validation. We also manually identified the travel behaviour of both 21 participants from ENABLE London (402,749 points), and 10 participants from a separate study (STAMP-2, 210,936 points), who were not included in the training data. We compared our predictions against this manual identification to further test accuracy and test generalisability. RESULTS: Applying the algorithm, we correctly identified travel mode 97.3\% of the time in cross-validation (mean sensitivity 96.3\%, mean active travel sensitivity 94.6\%). We showed 96.0\% agreement between manual identification and prediction of 21 individuals' travel modes (mean sensitivity 92.3\%, mean active travel sensitivity 84.9\%) and 96.5\% agreement between the STAMP-2 study and predictions (mean sensitivity 85.5\%, mean active travel sensitivity 78.9\%). CONCLUSION: We present a generalizable tool that identifies time spent stationary and time spent walking with very high precision, time spent in trains or vehicles with good precision, and time spent cycling with moderate precisionIn studies where both accelerometer and GPS data are available this tool complements analyses of physical activity, showing whether differences in PA may be explained by differences in travel mode. All code necessary to replicate, fit and predict to other datasets is provided to facilitate use by other researchers.},

Our comparative case study analysis is based on a wide range of statistical datasets, secondary reports, and interviews with a panel of 22 bicycling policy and planning experts. The main finding is that cycling levels in Melbourne are roughly twice as high as in Sydney and have been growing three times as fast in recent years. The difference is due to Melbourne's more favorable topography, climate, and road network as well as more supportive public policies. In particular, Melbourne has more and better integrated cycling infrastructure as well as more extensive cycling programs, advocacy, and promotional events. Melbourne also benefits from safer cycling than Sydney, which suffers from a lack of traffic-protected cycling facilities and aggressive motorist behavior toward cyclists on the road. While cycling has been increasing in Australia, it remains at very low levels relative to northern Europe, where both land use and transport policies are far more supportive of bicycling while discouraging car use through numerous restrictions and financial disincentives.},

Interventions include infrastructure (e.g., bike lanes and parking), integration with public transport, education and marketing programs, bicycle access programs, and legal issues. Methods A comprehensive search of peer-reviewed and non-reviewed research identified 139 studies. Study methodologies varied considerably in type and quality, with few meeting rigorous standards. Secondary data were gathered for 14 case study cities that adopted multiple interventions. Results Many studies show positive associations between specific interventions and levels of bicycling. The 14 case studies show that almost all cities adopting comprehensive packages of interventions experienced large increases in the number of bicycle trips and share of people bicycling. Conclusions Most of the evidence examined in this review supports the crucial role of public policy in encouraging bicycling. Substantial increases in bicycling require an integrated package of many different, complementary interventions, including infrastructure provision and pro-bicycle programs, supportive land use planning, and restrictions on car use.},

  abstract = {Intercity bus terminals are hotspots of air pollution due to concentrated activities of diesel buses. In order to evaluate the bus terminals' impact on air quality, it is necessary to estimate the associated mobile emission inventories. Since the vehicles' operating condition at the bus terminal varies significantly, conventional calculation of the emissions based on average emission factors suffers the loss of accuracy. In this study, we examined a typical intercity bus terminal\textemdash the Southern City Bus Station of Xi'an, China\textemdash using a multi-scale emission model\textemdash (US EPA's MOVES model)\textemdash to quantity the vehicle emission inventory. A representative operating cycle for buses within the station is constructed. The emission inventory was then estimated using detailed inputs including vehicle ages, operating speeds, operating schedules, and operating mode distribution, as well as meteorological data (temperature and humidity). Five functional areas (bus yard, platforms, disembarking area, bus travel routes within the station, and bus entrance/exit routes) at the terminal were identified, and the bus operation cycle was established using the micro-trip cycle construction method. Results of our case study showed that switching to compressed natural gas (CNG) from diesel fuel could reduce PM2.5 and CO emissions by 85.64 and 6.21 \%, respectively, in the microenvironment of the bus terminal. When CNG is used, tail pipe exhaust PM2.5 emission is significantly reduced, even less than brake wear PM2.5. The estimated bus operating cycles can also offer researchers and policy makers important information for emission evaluation in the planning and design of any typical intercity bus terminals of a similar scale.},

In this paper, a methodology is proposed to help planners make better decisions regarding the choice between a conventional fixed-route and a flex-route policy for a specific transit system with a varying passenger demand. A service quality function is developed to measure the performance of transit systems, and analytical modeling and simulations are used to reproduce transit operation under the two policies. To be closer to reality, two criteria are proposed depending on the processing of rejected requests in the assessment of the service quality function for flex-route services. In various scenarios, critical demand densities, which represent the switching points between the two competing policies, are derived in a real-world transit service according to the two criteria.

  abstract = {Sharing economy platforms have become extremely popular in the last few years, and they have changed the way in which we commute, travel, and borrow among many other activities. Despite their popularity among consumers, such companies are poorly regulated. For example, Airbnb, one of the most successful examples of sharing economy platform, is often criticized by regulators and policy makers. While, in theory, municipalities should regulate the emergence of Airbnb through evidence-based policy making, in practice, they engage in a false dichotomy: some municipalities allow the business without imposing any regulation, while others ban it altogether. That is because there is no evidence upon which to draft policies. Here we propose to gather evidence from the Web. After crawling Airbnb data for the entire city of London, we find out where and when Airbnb listings are offered and, by matching such listing information with census and hotel data, we determine the socio-economic conditions of the areas that actually benefit from the hospitality platform. The reality is more nuanced than one would expect, and it has changed over the years. Airbnb demand and offering have changed over time, and traditional regulations have not been able to respond to those changes. That is why, finally, we rely on our data analysis to envision regulations that are responsive to real-time demands, contributing to the emerging idea of ``algorithmic regulation''.},

The article shows how the location and characteristics of service providers can be depicted on a map that can be made available to clients. With the mapping of the ratio of child care slots to the number of children in the population, social services agency workers can locate areas with potential service-availability gaps. By mapping the take-up rate for child care subsidies, agencies can identify areas for potential client outreach. Finally, the article presents a map of the "daily schlep" for poor families in one area of Miami. This map suggests that the transportation problem of the poor primarily a work transportation problem and not a child care transportation issue and provides support for the hypothesis of a spatial mismatch between home and jobs for poor families.

Following Rose, we characterise the emergent forms of urban policy as part of `advanced liberalism' or strategies which seek to activate citizens, individually and collectively, to take greater responsibility for their own government. Such strategies are, as Rose notes, seeking to govern through the instrumentalisation of the self-governing properties of the subjects of government themselves in a whole variety of locales. We develop the argument in three parts. The first part justifies the use of a Foucauldian framework in seeking to understand the new political and policy agenda on 'rights and responsibilities'. In a second part, we investigate the changing nature of governmental rationalities and techniques of governmentality primarily through the context of the Single Regeneration Budget. In so doing, we consider two interrelated dimensions of the rationalities and techniques of government which seek to shape and guide what Foucault refers to as `the conduct of others' or those that are the objects of government, that is, active citizens. These dimensions are government through community and the specification of subjects of government. We conclude by specifying the importance we attach to using a Foucauldian framework for the analysis of urban policy and policy processes more generally.},

Secondly, an acceptable distance is computed from the cumulative trip length distribution based on the results of the statistical analysis. The socio-demographic and regional factors used in the study include purpose, age, gender, educational level, occupational status, and motor vehicle ownership. The major results include a significant difference between the mean trip distances on foot for the subcategories of variables such as gender, whether the respondent owned a private vehicle, and whether the trip was made inside the CBD.

  abstract = {We consider the necessary redistribution of bicycles in public bicycle sharing systems in order to avoid rental stations to run empty or entirely full. For this purpose we propose a general Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) with an embedded Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) that exploits a series of neighborhood structures. While this metaheuristic generates candidate routes for vehicles to visit unbalanced rental stations, the numbers of bikes to be loaded or unloaded at each stop are efficiently derived by one of three alternative methods based on a greedy heuristic, a maximum flow calculation, and linear programming, respectively. Tests are performed on instances derived from real-world data and indicate that the VNS based on a greedy heuristic represents the best compromise for practice. In general the VNS yields good solutions and scales much better to larger instances than two mixed integer programming approaches.},

In order to increase low-income housing, this review argues for state housing policy reform.

  abstract = {The rapid growth in the population density in urban cities demands that services and an infrastructure be provided to meet the needs of city inhabitants. Thus, there has been an increase in the request for embedded devices, such as sensors, actuators, and smartphones, leading to considerable business potential for the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), in which all devices are capable of interconnecting and communicating with each other over the Internet. Thus, Internet technologies provide a way of integrating and sharing a common communication medium. With this knowledge, in this paper, we propose a combined IoT-based system for smart city development and urban planning using Big Data analytics. We propose a complete system consisting of various types of sensor deployment, including smart home sensors, vehicular networking, weather and water sensors, smart parking sensors, and surveillance objects. A four-tier architecture is proposed that includes 1) Bottom tier-1, which is responsible for IoT sources and data generation and collection, 2) Intermediate tier-1, which is responsible for all types of communication between, for instance, sensors, relays, base stations, and the Internet, 3) Intermediate tier 2, which is responsible for data management and processing using a Hadoop framework, and 4) Top tier, which is responsible for application and usage of the data analysis and the results generated. The system implementation consists of various steps that begin with data generation and move to collection, aggregation, filtration, classification, preprocessing, computing and decision making. The proposed system is implemented using Hadoop with Spark, voltDB, Storm or S4 for real time processing of the IoT data to generate results to establish the smart city. For urban planning or city future development, the offline historical data are analyzed with Hadoop using MapReduce programming. IoT datasets generated by smart homes, smart parking weather, pollution, and vehicle data sets are used for analysis and evaluation. This type of system with full functionality does not currently exist. Similarly, the results demonstrate that the proposed system is more scalable and efficient than existing systems. Moreover, system efficiency is measured in terms of throughput and processing time.},

We explore who uses ridesourcing and for what reasons, how the ridesourcing market compares to that of traditional taxis, and how ridesourcing impacts the use of public transit and overall vehicle travel. In spring 2014, 380 completed intercept surveys were collected from three ridesourcing ``hot spots'' in San Francisco. We compare survey results with matched-pair taxi trip data and results of a previous taxi user survey. We also compare travel times for ridesourcing and taxis with those for public transit. The findings indicate that, despite many similarities, taxis and ridesourcing differ in user characteristics, wait times, and trips served. While ridesourcing replaces taxi trips, at least half of ridesourcing trips replaced modes other than taxi, including public transit and driving. Impacts on overall vehicle travel are unclear. We conclude with suggestions for future research.},

How can cities regulate short-term rentals in ways that generate inclusive opportunities for local wealth-creation, while still balancing the needs of all members of the community? The Sustainable Economies Law Center (SELC) has some suggestions.   Regulating Short-Term Rentals: A Guidebook for Equitable Policy helps equip cities to respond to short-term rentals in ways that protect public interests \textendash{} including housing affordability, health and safety, neighborhood quality, and municipal revenues \textendash{} while retaining reasonable latitude for city residents to host and earn money from short-term guests. Regulating Short-Term Rentals: A Guidebook for Equitable Policy identifies key issue areas, incorporates references to sample short-term rental ordinances from around the US, and provides SELC's recommendations for best practices. Because there is no one-size-fits all ordinance for STRs, we strongly encourage community stakeholder participation in the formation of any STR policy so that it accurately reflects local circumstances. This guidebook is intended to guide local government efforts to equitably regulate short-term rentals.},

While most local food systems share common characteristics, the chapters in this book explore the unique challenges and opportunities of local food systems located within mature and/or declining industrial regions. Local food systems have the potential to provide residents with a supply of safe and nutritious food; such systems also have the potential to create much-needed employment opportunities. However, challenges are numerous and include developing local markets of a sufficient scale, adequately matching supply and demand, and meeting the environmental challenges of finding safe growing locations. Interrogating the scale, scope, and economic context of local food systems in aging industrialized cities, this book provides a foundation for the development of new sub-fields in economic, urban, and agricultural geographies that focus on local food systems. The book represents a first attempt to provide a systematic picture of the opportunities and challenges facing the development of local food systems in old industrial regions.},

I will argue that even in the presence of a widely supported international agreement, a non-ratifying country can provide the setting for the emergence of non-state certification programs. This will happen when significant domestic legislation on the topics covered by the agreement is absent, and non-state actors are able to act as institutional entrepreneurs with an interest in implementing key elements of this agreement. By tracing the development of certification programs for the electronic waste (e-waste) recycling industry, I will show why the US, more than other countries, provided an enabling environment for the emergence of non-state e-waste recycling certification. The US's failure to ratify the Basel Convention on transboundary movements of hazardous wastes and an overall lack of domestic legislation on e-waste exports created regulatory gaps that non-state actors were able to fill. The main global watchdog of the Convention-the US-based Basel Action Network-used certification as a forum-shifting strategy to implement key parts of the Convention in the US. Finally, the article will also show that conflicting interests and divergent perspectives on the legitimacy of the Convention and its rules have led to the development of a competing industry-supported certification program.},

It also undertakes a city-wide equity analysis of Perth and compares this with a published analysis for Melbourne. Overall the public transport distribution of the three socially disadvantaged groups was identified to be less equitable when compared to the population as a whole. The elderly had the most inequitable distribution of population relative to other cohorts. Perth's population exhibits a 0.52 Gini coefficient suggesting a relatively unequal spatial distribution of services to the population. However, this is much better than Melbourne (at 0.68). Results imply that 70\% of Perth's population have only 33\% of services supplied, whilst in Melbourne this figure was 19\%. Policy implications and areas for future research in this field were identified.},

  abstract = {Despite the popularity of bike sharing, there is a lack of evidence on existing schemes and whether they achieved their objectives. This paper is concerned with identifying and critically interpreting the available evidence on bike sharing to date, on both impacts and processes of implementation and operation. The existing evidence suggests that bike sharing can increase cycling levels but needs complementary pro-cycling measures and wider support to sustainable urban mobility to thrive. Whilst predominantly enabling commuting, bike sharing allows users to undertake other key economic, social and leisure activities. Benefits include improved health, increased transport choice and convenience, reduced travel times and costs, and improved travel experience. These benefits are unequally distributed, since users are typically male, younger and in more advantaged socio-economic positions than average. There is no evidence that bike sharing significantly reduces traffic congestion, carbon emissions and pollution. From a process perspective, bike sharing can be delivered through multiple governance models. A key challenge to operation is network rebalancing, while facilitating factors include partnership working and inclusive scheme promotion. The paper suggests directions for future research and concludes that high-quality monitoring impact/process data, systematically and consistently collected, as well as innovative and inclusive evaluation methods are needed.},

The author conducted more than 3000 transcribed pages of interviews and performed the detective work necessary to reveal an unlikely logic that held together a network of symbols, images, and metaphors that together present powerful mythical beliefs in the guise of truth. Transport of Delight is a true interdisciplinary work, and includes a thorough analytical assessment of the Los Angeles rail program, with a focus on the Long Beach Blue Line light rail \textemdash{} the first of the new projects to go ahead. En route, it shows that ridership forecasting for this project was not only biased and statistically invalid, but in fact done to justify decisions made on other grounds. A political analysis shows how consensus was reached to proceed with the light rail to Long Beach, but political explanations are ultimately found lacking, because they cannot explain why decision-makers would want to put the rail in place. It is only when provocative metaphors\textemdash of the need to connect communities and to restore a mythical balance to a dysfunctional transportation system\textemdash and symbols\textemdash of escape from the pressure cooker of poverty, of urban success, power and, indeed sexual acumen: the train is revealed as both a woman and a penis\textemdash are surfaced, that we realize that Los Angeles' Transport of Delight is the result of the very human need to transcend complexity by providing mythical creations that appear to offer easy answers to society's deepest problems. --This text refers to the Hardcover edition.}

Combining this problem with an inefficient use of parking spaces leads to congestions due to aggregation of parking seekers and regular drivers. Recent advances in low-cost, low-power embedded systems bring the opportunity to develop new applications to solve these problems. In particular, Smart Cities greatly enrich their sustainability by introducing new resource management applications that rely in those constrained devices a significant part of the functionality of the system. The proposed Smart Parking solution consists mainly in the on-site deployment of an IoT solution to monitor and signalize the state of availability of each single parking space, as well as using context information generated by the city and its citizens to provide accurate responses to driver's demands. Furthermore, this system improves the management of parking resources by public authorities, for instance handling groups of parking spaces facilitating the whole city traffic management. The integration of this deployment into an existing live test-bed implies an easy task requiring just the data collection through the available means of the parking spaces availability. At the present time there exist living test-beds which can be used to integrate these new functionalities for experimentation on IoT data level, to gain a better knowledge and understanding of the M2M world, reducing costs, resources, pollution and time.},

TDM provides lessons for communities looking to encourage greater levels of bicycle riding. To do this we review the literature on best practices in marketing to women, and evaluate different bicycle marketing guides. We find, after an analysis to pinpoint best practices, that only 15\% of the marketing guides are targeted to women. The lessons learned from our study provide information for the design of future bicycle guides that will appeal to women consumers.},

  abstract = {Environmental gentrification, or the influx of wealthy residents to historically disenfranchised neighborhoods due to new green spaces, is an increasingly common phenomenon around the globe. In particular, investments in large green infrastructure projects (LGIPs) such as New York's High Line have contributed to displacing long-term low-income residents. Many consider environmental gentrification to be an important environmental justice issue, but most of this research has focused on distributional justice; that is, quantifying whether LGIPs have indeed contributed to gentrifying neighborhoods around them. Limited work has focused on procedural justice in the context of environmental gentrification, or how planning processes can shape project outcomes. This is a particularly critical oversight because many LGIP planning processes are led by nonprofits, a governance model that has already raised important equity concerns in the context of planning and maintenance of smaller neighborhood parks. Yet less is known about the impacts of park nonprofits leading LGIPs. To address these gaps, we study the planning process of the 606, a rails-to-trails project located in Chicago, U.S. that contributed to environmental gentrification. Through interviews with key actors and a review of planning documents, we find that although delegation of leadership to park nonprofits has some benefits, a number of drawbacks also arise that might make gentrification a more likely outcome, namely the fragmentation of efforts to develop economically viable LGIPs while also preserving affordable housing. These findings suggest the need for cross-sectoral municipal planning efforts and for building more robust coalitions comprised of parks and housing nonprofits.},

Despite legal mandates to incorporate environmental justice, the California Bay-Delta Authority's (CBDA) policy-development process and the subsequent Delta Vision process have systematically marginalized the role of environmental justice in California's water policy. We suggest that environmental justice in Bay-Delta planning can be understood as a ``third party'' with a tenuous seat at the CALFED water management table. As such environmental justice is a useful lens through which to assess the state's broader commitments and capacities relative to equity as a planning principal and outcome. We interpret the fate of environmental justice within Bay-Delta planning as indicative of the inherent tensions between systems based on increasing market dominance and state legitimation and the values of environmental justice based on distributive, procedural, and cognitive justice. We construct a model of marginalization and environmental injustice in collaborative planning to illustrate these tensions. We draw upon experiences of members of the Environmental Justice Sub-Committee of CBDA's Bay Delta Public Advisory Committee, as well as interviews with other key environmental justice interests, and a comprehensive review of internal and public CBDA documents relating to the environmental justice program including budgets and program plans, and ethnographic field work. We conclude that by learning from the mistakes of Bay-Delta planning, a positive model of collaborative, environmental justice-based planning for water and ecosystem management is possible.

However, few studies have explored the design of speech-based over-the-phone guidance systems. This study examined the effect of landmarks' use and the effect of landmarks' frames of reference in route instructions on navigation efficiency during map navigation tasks and satisfaction. Twenty-seven participants performed map navigation tasks using a simulated speech navigation system in three experimental conditions: instructions containing no landmarks, instructions containing landmarks located without reference to either the traveler's body or the surrounding environment, and instructions containing landmarks located with respect to the traveler's body. Navigation performances on maps were higher and landmarks enable participants to make fewer directional errors and find their routes more efficiently. Satisfaction levels and navigation performances were lower when instructions did not contain any landmarks. Landmarks' frames of reference shifting turned out to be different between human\textendash human situations previously used and human\textendash computer situations used here.},

To better understand these factors, we investigated racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality among America's essential workers. Data from the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey was used to examine the correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 deaths and occupational differences across racial/ethnic groups and states. COVID-19 mortality was higher among non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks compared with NH Whites, due to more NH Blacks holding essential-worker positions. Vulnerability to coronavirus exposure was increased among NH Blacks, who disproportionately occupied the top nine essential occupations. As COVID-19 death rates continue to rise, existing structural inequalities continue to shape racial disparities in this pandemic. Policies mandating the disaggregation of state-level data by race/ethnicity are vital to ensure equitable and evidence-based response and recovery efforts.},

The distinguishing feature of the technology as an input is that it is neither a conventional good nor a public good; it is a nonrival, partially excludable good. Because of the nonconvexity introduced by a nonrival good, price-taking competition cannot be supported. Instead, the equilibrium is one with monopolistic competition. The main conclusions are that the stock of human capital determines the rate of growth, that too little human capital is devoted to research in equilibrium, that integration into world markets will increase growth rates, and that having a large population is not sufficient to generate growth.},

Recognising the inadequacies of landfill, waste management authorities proposed incineration, but large-scale incineration provoked more public concern and protest. Concerns about toxicity of incinerator emissions led to tighter regulation, but as evidence of the impacts of air pollution upon human health has hardened, opposition to incineration has persisted. The inequitable distribution of exposure to waste-related risks has generalised demands for environmental justice. There is variation in the extent to which anti-incinerator campaigns are networked among themselves and with environmental NGOs, but such networking has increased and is now transnational. New technologies mitigate some of the hazards of modern waste management but are unlikely to eliminate public protest over the siting of waste infrastructure.},

Surveying a random sample of 332 participants, it is found that suburban movers are about 13\% more likely to have a job postmove than are city movers, even among those who had never had a job before moving. Multivariate analysis shows that these differences are significant even after controlling for respondents' previous work history, human capital, \& personal characteristics. These results suggest that low-income urban blacks experience significant gains in employment by moving to middle-class suburbs. Factors that facilitated employment in the suburbs \& the types of barriers that participants encountered are discussed, along with implications of these findings for policymakers \& scholars concerned about assisting recipients to move from welfare to work.

We discuss whether there is a potential role for CS in medium to small-sized towns and in less-densely populated rural areas. In large cities CS is provided by large profit oriented firms, capable of offering efficient and flexible services, using the most advanced technologies with highly differentiated and customized prices. In lower density areas and small-to-medium size cities the challenges are much greater. The lower demand resulting from a complex of unfavorable factors (higher car ownership level, larger parking availability, low public transport service, fewer or absent taxi service and so on) requires a different business model for the provision of CS: more socially oriented, with a greater involvement of local municipalities and public transport operators to offer a service, most likely at favorable prices. The paper reports the results drawn from a survey on the potential demand for CS conducted in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy, a region characterized by small-sized towns and less-densely populated rural areas where CS is not currently offered. It is found that there is a not negligible demand (3.7\% of the population holding a driving license) and that the likely users would be the ones that are better informed about CS, environmentally conscious and young. They would be more frequent among students or unemployed people, rather than among professionals, as in the more urban environments. It is also found that CS would mostly be used for non-commuting and longer trips.},

The lower demand resulting from a complex of unfavorable factors (higher car ownership level, larger parking availability, low public transport service, fewer or absent taxi service and so on) requires a different business model for the provision of CS: more socially oriented, with a greater involvement of local municipalities and public transport operators to offer a service, most likely at favorable prices. The paper reports the results drawn from a survey on the potential demand for CS conducted in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, Italy, a region characterized by small-sized towns and less-densely populated rural areas where CS is not currently offered. It is found that there is a not negligible demand (3.7\% of the population holding a driving license) and that the likely users would be the ones that are better informed about CS, environmentally conscious and young. They would be more frequent among students or unemployed people, rather than among professionals, as in the more urban environments. It is also found that CS would mostly be used for non-commuting and longer trips.},

  abstract = {The City of Toronto adopted its Vision Zero Road Safety Plan in July 2016, with its focus on eliminating motor vehicle collisions that result in death and serious injuries. The safety plan emphasizes a collaborative and integrative approach, involving multiple stakeholders. One of the Plan's six areas of emphasis is on school children. Stakeholders from public health, the public school board, the police, a not-for- profit organization and academic researchers have worked with the City of Toronto's Transportation Services Division to identify a package of interventions to create School Safety Zones. New interventions include physical environment changes, enforcement activities, education and support from a school traffic management facilitator. The Plan is intended to be evidence-based and data-driven. Therefore, it is essential that policy makers and researchers work together to develop appropriate evaluation strategies. Several challenges to policy makers and researchers working together exist; most of which can be overcome using a collaborative process. For example, funding cycles and priorities of granting agencies to fund academic research may not match the timelines and priorities of policy makers. Researchers prefer evidence-based priority setting and random selection to enhance scientific validity, whereas policy makers also consider political priorities and community interests. Although researchers would ideally like to maximize sample size, policy makers often have fiscal restraints. The definition of meaningful and valid outcome measurements is a challenge. Fatal and severe collisions are relatively rare, so proxy measures must be agreed upon prior to the evaluation. Regular meetings of stakeholders will help ensure evaluation that is meaningful to policy makers and scientifically sound. This process will lead to a strategy to be used by City of Toronto, Transportation Services to evaluate the effectiveness of their school zone safety interventions and can provide a model for future evaluations of Vision Zero Road Safety Plan interventions.},

Exploding the myth of de facto segregation arising from private prejudice or the unintended consequences of economic forces, Rothstein describes how the American government systematically imposed residential segregation: with undisguised racial zoning; public housing that purposefully segregated previously mixed communities; subsidies for builders to create whites-only suburbs; tax exemptions for institutions that enforced segregation; and support for violent resistance to African Americans in white neighborhoods. A groundbreaking, ``virtually indispensable'' study that has already transformed our understanding of twentieth-century urban history (Chicago Daily Observer), The Color of Law forces us to face the obligation to remedy our unconstitutional past. 13 illustrations},

However, such regimes of civic governmentality operate within frontiers of urban renewal and indeed often facilitate and manage such types of development. The article examines the limits and contradictions of the politics of inclusion in the context of the bourgeois city and also studies radical forms of citizenship that emerge to challenge these limits.},

The entities can be individuals or firms and the choices can include housing, jobs, production quantities, exports, imports, face-to-face contacts, schools, retail centres and activity centres. The first SI models can be grouped under the generic heading gravity models. Their main characteristic is that they model the behaviour of demand or supply segments, rather than that of individuals and firms. This article traces the development of these models from their inception in the early part of the twentieth century to the present. The key advances include the replacement of the gravity analogy by the more general concepts of entropy or information theory, a statistical framework commonly used in physics. With the arrival of the regional science paradigm over 50 years ago, a key challenge has been to broaden these models compared to those arising in spatial economics, thus arriving at a more inclusive probabilistic framework. These efforts are discussed here, as well as inclusion of geographical advances, embracing activities as generators of travel, time-geography, recognition of spatial interdependencies, and use of neuro-computing principles.},

One of the remaining problems is that the distribution of rides between stations is not uniformly distributed and certain stations fill up or empty over time. These empty and full stations lead to demand for bikes and return boxes that cannot be fulfilled leading to unsatisfied and possibly even lost customers. To avoid this situation, bikes in the systems are redistributed by the provider. While redistribution of bikes in such systems is well studied, the underlying demand is not yet modeled to serve as an input to improve the redistribution. This gap is closed in this paper. We model demand for bikes and return boxes using data from the BSS Citybike Wien in Vienna, Austria. In particular, the influence of weather and full/empty neighboring stations on demand is studied using different count models. Furthermore, we show that forecasts from our model improve the forecast using historic demands. Lastly, the influence of new stations on the model parameters of a station and resulting structural breaks in the model are discussed.},

Flow results from the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code FLUENT are validated against wind tunnel data (CEDVAL). Dispersion results from FLUENT are analysed using the well-validated atmos pheric dispersion model ADMS-Urban. The k - {$\epsilon$} turbulence model and the advection-diffusion (AD) method are used for the CFD simulations. Sensitivity of dispersion results to wind direction within street canyons of aspect ratio equal to 1 is investigated. The analysis shows that the CFD model well reproduces the wind tunnel flow measurements and compares adequately with ADMS-Urban dispersion predictions for a simple traffic source by using a slightly modified k - {$\epsilon$} model. It is found that a Schmidt number of 0.4 is the most appropriate number for the simulation of a simple traffic source and in street canyons except for the case when the wind direction is perpendicular to the street canyon axis. For this last case a Schmidt number equal to 0.04 gives the best agreement with ADMS-Urban. Overall the modified k - {$\epsilon$} turbulence model may be accurate for the simulation of pollutant dispersion in street canyons provided that an appropriate choice for coefficients in the turbulence model and the Schmidt number in the diffusion model are made.},

We propose an Environmental Justice Screening Method (EJSM) as a relatively simple, flexible and transparent way to examine the relative rank of cumulative impacts and social vulnerability within metropolitan regions and determine environmental justice areas based on more than simply the demographics of income and race. We specifically organize 23 indicator metrics into three categories: (1) hazard proximity and land use; (2) air pollution exposure and estimated health risk; and (3) social and health vulnerability. For hazard proximity, the EJSM uses GIS analysis to create a base map by intersecting land use data with census block polygons, and calculates hazard proximity measures based on locations within various buffer distances. These proximity metrics are then summarized to the census tract level where they are combined with tract centroid-based estimates of pollution exposure and health risk and socio-economic status (SES) measures. The result is a cumulative impacts (CI) score for ranking neighborhoods within regions that can inform diverse stakeholders seeking to identify local areas that might need targeted regulatory strategies to address environmental justice concerns.},

Relevant options for policy change have been explored in light of evaluations of geographic disparities in food access, but the dominant `food desert' discourse often focuses uncritically on insufficient conceptions of access. Understanding the complexity of food deserts is important for moving into meaningful policy action. We present a theoretical position to inspire future empirical research. The ecological model recognizes both endogenous and built environment factors in shaping health. Interventions in the food environment, however, often concentrate exclusively on structural determinants of health (e.g. retail-based initiatives). Yet retail-based interventions are difficult to implement due to governance systems which limit the ability of government bodies to influence private retail development. As well, recognizing the complexity of debates over the influence of structure and agency, we apply structuration theory to food deserts. Behavioral economics further informs both structural and behavioral determinants of health. This approach sidesteps the issue of victim-blaming, as all consumers are viewed as `predictably irrational' in decision-making. In combining these theories, we challenge methodological and theoretical assumptions by showing the complexity of food desert interventions. Policy recommendations focus on behavioral determinants of health and the opportunities for empowerment through local food systems. These recommendations recognize the limits of translating research into policy and in devising effective food based interventions, and are sensitive to social, economic, and political constraints uncovered throughout the paper.},

  abstract = {To reverse the global epidemic of physical inactivity that is responsible for more than 5 million deaths per year, many groups recommend creating ``activity-friendly environments.'' Such environments may have other benefits, beyond facilitating physical activity, but these potential co-benefits have not been well described. The purpose of the present paper is to explore a wide range of literature and conduct an initial summary of evidence on co-benefits of activity-friendly environments. An extensive but non-systematic review of scientific and ``gray'' literature was conducted. Five physical activity settings were defined: parks/open space/trails, urban design, transportation, schools, and workplaces/buildings. Several evidence-based activity-friendly features were identified for each setting. Six potential outcomes/co-benefits were searched: physical health, mental health, social benefits, safety/injury prevention, environmental sustainability, and economics. A total of 418 higher-quality findings were summarized. The overall summary indicated 22 of 30 setting by outcome combinations showed ``strong'' evidence of co-benefits. Each setting had strong evidence of at least three co-benefits, with only one occurrence of a net negative effect. All settings showed the potential to contribute to environmental sustainability and economic benefits. Specific environmental features with the strongest evidence of multiple co-benefits were park proximity, mixed land use, trees/greenery, accessibility and street connectivity, building design, and workplace physical activity policies/programs. The exploration revealed substantial evidence that designing community environments that make physical activity attractive and convenient is likely to produce additional important benefits. The extent of the evidence justifies systematic reviews and additional research to fill gaps.},

Forecasts of telecommuting and its impacts have typically overestimated the adoption of this arrangement. The paper reviews the problems of forecasting a complex solution to social problems. It critically assesses the wide range of forecasting approaches applied to telecommuting and the reasons for the upwards bias. The appeal of the concept, combined with various interests are among the reasons for the optimistic forecasts. Methodologically, forecasts of telecommuting tend to emphasize technological change while underestimating the social implications which determine the adoption of such technologies. A choice theory is suggested as an alternative approach which can address issues related to human behavior in the context of technological change. The explanatory power of choice models is demonstrated and suggested for future analysis of technologies which entail extensive adaptation for adopters and institutions.},

  abstract = {Urban transit systems in most American cities\ldots have become a genuine civil rights issue-and a valid one-because the layout of rapid-transit systems determines the accessibility of jobs to the Black community. If transportation systems in American cities could be laid out so as to provide an opportunity for poor people to get meaningful employment, then they could begin to move into the mainstream of American life. A good example of this problem is my home city of Atlanta, where the rapid-transit system has been laid out for the convenience of the white upper-middle-class suburbanites who commute to their jobs downtown. The system has virtually no consideration for connecting the poor people with their jobs. There is only one possible explanation for this situation, and that is the racist blindness of city planners. Martin Luther King, Jr. (1986, pp. 325-326) Much attention is being paid to the role of public transit in employment-related mobility for urban residents, yet there is very little evidence of the degree to which one affects the other. Little research has focused on how labor participation is affected by increases in urban workers' access to public transportation. Research on the spatial mismatch hypothesis has dealt with the relationship between labor participation and the spatial separation of workers' residences from suitable jobs; however, most analyses concentrate on commuting time or distance as a function of auto use. Few studies have considered the impacts of public transportation on labor participation. This article describes a study analyzing the locations and employment characteristics of workers with varying levels of access to public transit. Using census data and a variety of spatial measures generated by a geographic information system (GIS), a two-stage least squares regression was used to estimate the relationship of access to public transit with labor participation levels for Portland, Oregon, and Atlanta, Georgia. The results suggest that access to public transit is a significant factor in determining average rates of labor participation within these two cities.},

At the same time, policies for improving the conditions of low-income persons have remained relatively unchanged. Relevant published accounts continue to cite poorly integrated residential and employment location patterns and poor public transportation service as critical obstacles to improving the economic and social conditions of low-income persons. The relationship between poverty and public transportation was researched extensively during the late 1960s and the early 1970s; however, little recognition has been given to these efforts by more recent research efforts. To learn from the past we should review public transportation policies from 1960 to 2000 to highlight federal policies that affected urban areas during this time period, especially in relation to low-income transportation mobility.},

Using demographic information (e.g., gender or age) and surrogates for environmental exposure (e.g., tobacco usage or the average number of minutes spent in an enclosed workshop), we identify subgroup differences in exposure routes. Missing and censored data, as well as uncertainty due to measurement error, are handled systematically in the Bayesian framework. Our analysis indicates that household size, amount of time spent at home, use of tapwater for drinking and cooking, number of glasses of water drunk, use of central air conditioning, and use of gas equipment significantly modify the arsenic exposure pathways.},

With growth in sharing economy platforms such as Uber for ridesharing and Airbnb for short-term accommodations, interest in examining spatiotemporal patterns of participation in the sharing economy by suppliers and consumers is increasing. This research is motivated by key questions: who are the sharing economy workers, where are they located, and does their location influence their participation in the sharing economy? This paper is the first systematic effort to analyze spatiotemporal patterns of participation by hosts in the shared accommodation-based economy. Using three different kinds of shared accommodations listed in a 3-year period in the popular short-term accommodation platform, Airbnb, we examine spatiotemporal dimensions of host participation in a major U.S. market, Los Angeles CA. The paper also develops a conceptual model by positing associations of demographic, socioeconomic, occupational, and social capital attributes of hosts, along with their attitudes toward trust and greener consumption with hosts' participation in a shared accommodation market. Results confirm host participation to be influenced by young dependency ratio, the potential of supplemental income, as well as the sustainability potential of collaborative consumption, along with finance, insurance, and real estate occupation, but not so much by trust for our overall study area. These results add new insights to limited prior knowledge about the sharing economy worker and have policy implications.},

A secondary aim was to develop tri-axial vector magnitude (VM3) cut-points to classify physical activity (PA) intensity. Methods: Fifty participants wore the GT3X and the GT1M on the non-dominant hip and exercised at 4 treadmill speeds (4.8, 6.4, 9.7, and 12kmh-1). Vertical (VT) and antero-posterior (AP) activity counts (countsmin-1) as well as the vector magnitudes of the two axes (VM2) from both monitors were tested for significant differences using two-way ANOVA's. Bland\textendash Altman plots were used to assess agreement between activity counts from the GT3X and GT1M. Linear regression analysis between VM3 countsmin-1 and oxygen consumption data was conducted to develop VM3 cut-points for moderate, hard and very hard PA. Results: There were no significant inter-monitor differences in VT activity counts at any speed. AP and VM2 activity counts from the GT1M were significantly higher (p{$<$}0.01) than those from the GT3X at 4.8, 9.7 and 12kmh-1. High inter-monitor agreement was found for VT activity counts but not for AP and VM2 activity counts. VM3 cut-points for moderate, hard, and very hard PA intensities were 2690\textendash 6166, 6167\textendash 9642, {$>$}9642countsmin-1. Conclusion: Due to the lack of congruence between the AP and VM2 activity counts from the GT1M and the GT3X, comparisons of data obtained with these two monitors should be avoided when using more than just the VT axis. VM3 cut-points may be used to classify PA in future studies.},

It considers the new intensity and complexity of globally-connected systems of production, finance and management which may disperse production, yet need (relatively few) networks of cities to provide their organizational and management architecture. This produces new geographies and hierarchies of centrality - particular cities and regions that have key roles in globalization. Many such cities become far more closely linked to the global economy than to their regional or national economies - and this can have harsh consequences locally, pushing out firms and people that are not within the internationalized sector. The paper discusses why certain cities retain such importance, when production is so dispersed and when telecommunications and rapid transport systems have limited the advantages of spatial concentration. It also considers the dependence of global cities on each other; a crisis in one key centre often brings problems rather than opportunities for others.},

  abstract = {The authors argue that analysis of urban labor market conditions must include the impact of migration. This study uses 1990 census data to examine the population and labor market characteristics of Atlanta, Georgia, metropolitan area over three decades, the characteristics of the in-migrant population during 1985-90, and the job prospects for long-term residents compared to migrants. The economic growth in the regional economy of Atlanta did not improve economic conditions for young, low-skilled Blacks. Atlanta has a diversified economy and job growth peaked in 1984. Net migration rates also peaked around the same time. Women's entry into the labor force resulted in a decline in the ratio of total population to total employment. Over the past 20 years, Black male employment as a proportion of total employment remained the same. During 1985-90, Atlanta had the highest net internal migration in the United States. Eight other states in addition to Georgia contributed to the high net migration of new low-skilled workers to Atlanta. In The Atlanta Project area (TAP) Black men had very high rates of unemployment and proportion not in the labor force and the lowest rates of labor force participation. Extreme joblessness was high among Black men living in the inner city and Black south side of the metropolitan area. Job growth was greatest in the northern suburban tracts. Most in-migrants were 20-34 years old. The Atlanta region had the highest number of Black poverty and Black college educated in-migrants in the country. In-migrants were 23\% of the low-skill pool, 25\% of the intermediate-skill pool, and 29\% of the high-skill pool. During 1985-90, 126,954 low-skilled in-migrants competed with 421,794 long-term low-skilled Atlanta residents. Spatial mismatch is evident in the location of in-migrants in tracts with job growth in the service sector, and resident population located in areas with no growth in the service sector. In-migrating Blacks experienced higher unemployment than in-migrating Whites. Natives and specifically Black natives had higher unemployment rates than in-migrants.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, trends in travel behaviour have been characterised by increasing trip distances and a modal shift towards the private car. This paper reports findings from longitudinal analyses of the German nation-wide travel survey KONTIV for the period 1976\textendash 2002. It focuses on travel mode choice, subdivided by distance categories, and also takes car availability and city size into account. In addition, trends in car availability itself are examined by city size categories. The results indicate that even within the same distance categories car use has considerably increased. In some cases bicycle use has increased as well. Gains in the use of the private car are mainly at the expense of trips on foot and by public transport. Accordingly, the shift in modal split towards the car is not (only) caused by increasing trip distances but took place even within distance classes. Once car availability is taken into account, the modal shifts appear to be considerably weaker. This suggests that once car availability is held constant the decision rationales of mode choice for a certain trip distance have remained relatively stable. The increase in motorisation over the study period was considerably weaker in large cities than in small towns, although the cities started from a lower level in the 1970s. Thus, the motorisation divide between cities on the one hand, and suburban and rural areas on the other hand has become ever wider. For travel mode choice, the picture is similar. What is more, the results suggest that even car owners are more inclined to walk a given distance in the cities than in small towns, even more so if they live in a central urban area. The built environment, thus, appears to have a strong impact on whether an available car is used or not.},

  abstract = {The emergence of portable global positioning system (GPS) receivers over the last 10 years has provided researchers with a means to objectively assess spatial position in free-living conditions. However, the use of GPS in free-living conditions is not without challenges and the aim of this study was to test the dynamic accuracy of a portable GPS device under real-world environmental conditions, for four modes of transport, and using three data collection intervals. We selected four routes on different bearings, passing through a variation of environmental conditions in the City of Copenhagen, Denmark, to test the dynamic accuracy of the Qstarz BT-Q1000XT GPS device. Each route consisted of a walk, bicycle, and vehicle lane in each direction. The actual width of each walking, cycling, and vehicle lane was digitized as accurately as possible using ultra-high-resolution aerial photographs as background. For each trip, we calculated the percentage that actually fell within the lane polygon, and within the 2.5, 5, and 10 m buffers respectively, as well as the mean and median error in meters. Our results showed that 49.6\% of all {$\approx$}68,000 GPS points fell within 2.5 m of the expected location, 78.7\% fell within 10 m and the median error was 2.9 m. The median error during walking trips was 3.9, 2.0 m for bicycle trips, 1.5 m for bus, and 0.5 m for car. The different area types showed considerable variation in the median error: 0.7 m in open areas, 2.6 m in half-open areas, and 5.2 m in urban canyons. The dynamic spatial accuracy of the tested device is not perfect, but we feel that it is within acceptable limits for larger population studies. Longer recording periods, for a larger population are likely to reduce the potentially negative effects of measurement inaccuracy. Furthermore, special care should be taken when the environment in which the study takes place could compromise the GPS signal.},

  abstract = {While calls for 'environmental justice' have grown recently, very little attention has been paid to exactly what the 'justice' of environmental justice refers to, particularly in the realm of social movement demands. Most understandings of environmental justice refer to the issue of equity, or the distribution of environmental ills and benefits. But defining environmental justice as equity is incomplete, as activists, communities, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) call for much more than just distribution. This essay examines how definitions beyond the distributive in these movements can help us develop conceptions of global environmental justice. The argument is that the justice demanded by global environmental justice is really threefold: equity in the distribution of environmental risk, recognition of the diversity of the participants and experiences in affected communities, and participation in the political processes which create and manage environmental policy. The existence of three different notions of justice in the movement, simultaneously, demonstrates the plausibility of a plural yet unified theory and practice of justice.},

In particular, the test distribution across income levels is significantly more egalitarian than the distribution of income itself: The ten percent of the city's population living in the richest zip codes received 11 percent of the Covid-19 tests and 29 percent of the city's income. The ten percent of the city's population living in the poorest zip codes received 10 percent of the tests but only 4 percent of the city's income. At the same time, we find significant disparity in the fraction of tests that come back negative for the Covid-19 disease across income levels: moving from the poorest zip codes to the richest zip codes is associated with an increase in the fraction of negative Covid-19 test results from 38 to 65 percent.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Attracting and retaining public transport users is fundamental to a number of land use and transport policy objectives which seek to reduce single-occupant vehicle travel. Understanding the psychological processes underlying unfamiliar public transport use may assist in achieving this aim. This paper explores unfamiliar transit travel using a survey conducted through an online travel planning website in Melbourne, Australia. The survey obtained `before and after' travel data and explored the circumstances of unfamiliar travel, travel experiences, and the impact of these experiences on attitudes and behavior. A total of 3,537 `before' responses and 658 eligible `after' surveys were obtained including 152 unfamiliar transit journeys. Compared with familiar travel, unfamiliar travel was more commonly associated with: life events, less time living in Melbourne, travel companionship, visiting new locations, and non-work-related trip purposes. Unfamiliar travel experiences were rated more negatively for `navigation' and `emotional state (level of anxiety)' and more positively for `expected versus actual travel time' and `level of comfort'. Analysis of travel attribute ratings and intention to re-patronize services indicated that there was a significant relationship between positive trip experiences and intention to re-patronize services for all users, and particularly for unfamiliar travelers. These results suggest that unfamiliar public travel experiences are quite different to familiar travel and are important to optimize to encourage re-patronization and help grow public transport markets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In order to identify strategies that may be most effective at increasing pedestrian and bicycle transportation in a specific local context, practitioners need a greater understanding of the underlying thought process that people use to select travel modes. Previous research from the travel behavior and psychology fields provides the foundation for a five-step, operational Theory of Routine Mode Choice Decisions. Walking and bicycling could be promoted through each of the five steps: awareness and availability (e.g., offer individual marketing programs), basic safety and security (e.g., make pedestrian and bicycle facility improvements and increase education and enforcement efforts), convenience and cost (e.g., institute higher-density, mixed land uses, and limited, more expensive automobile parking), enjoyment (e.g., plant street trees and increase awareness of non-motorized transportation benefits), and habit (e.g., target information about sustainable transportation options to people making key life changes). The components of the theory are supported by in-depth interview responses from the San Francisco Bay Area.},

  abstract = {Bikeshare systems are relatively new, highly visible additions to urban transportation systems that provide opportunities to cycle or combine cycling with other modes of transportation. The research reported here presents new evidence about the role of bikeshare systems in travel behavior on the basis of diffusion of innovation theory. The study hypothesized that bikeshare systems have spatial contagion or spillover effects on (a) the propensity of individuals to adopt bikeshare and (b) the propensity to bicycle within the general population. The first hypothesis (H1) was tested by modeling membership growth as a function of system expansion and the existing, proximate membership base. The second hypothesis (H2) was tested by using bikeshare activity levels near home in a model of household-level bicycle participation and trip frequency. The study yielded mixed results. Bikeshare membership growth appeared to be driven in small part by a contagion effect of existing bikeshare members nearby, even after controlling for system growth. However, within the general population, a significant relationship was not identified between proximity to bikeshare stations and cycling participation or frequency. These findings complement those of other recent studies of bikeshare systems, which indicated that systems are still evolving. The present findings also have implications for marketing, infrastructure investments, and future research about bikeshare operations and innovation.},

Platforms such as Airbnb and Uber are experiencing explosive growth, which, in turn, has led to regulatory and political battles. Boosters claim the new technologies will yield utopian outcomes - empowerment of ordinary people, efficiency, and even lower carbon footprints. Critics denounce them for being about economic self-interest rather than sharing, and for being predatory and exploitative. Not surprisingly, the reality is more complex. This essay, based on more than three years of study of both non-profit and for-profit initiatives in the "sharing economy," discusses what's new and not so new about the sector and how the claims of proponents and critics stack up. While the for-profit companies may be "acting badly," these new technologies of peer-to-peer economic activity are potentially powerful tools for building a social movement centered on genuine practices of sharing and cooperation in the production and consumption of goods and services. But achieving that potential will require democratizing the ownership and governance of the platforms.},

  abstract = {One of APA's most popular and influential books is finally in PAPE, with a new preface from the author on how thinking about parking has changed since this book was first published. In this no-holds-barred treatise, Shoup argues that free parking has contributed to auto dependence, rapid urban sprawl, extravagant energy use, and a host of other problems. Planners mandate free parking to alleviate congestion but end up distorting transportation choices, debasing urban design, damaging the economy, and degrading the environment. Ubiquitous free parking helps explain why our cities sprawl on a scale fit more for cars than for people, and why American motor vehicles now consume one-eighth of the world's total oil production. But it doesn't have to be this way. Shoup proposes new ways for cities to regulate parking - namely, charge fair market prices for curb parking, use the resulting revenue to pay for services in the neighborhoods that generate it, and remove zoning requirements for off-street parking. Such measures, according to the Yale-trained economist and UCLA planning professor, will make parking easier and driving less necessary. Join the swelling ranks of Shoupistas by picking up this book today. You'll never look at a parking spot the same way again.},

We expect a great potential for sharing services especially on intermodal trips. We aim at developing and evaluating intermodal electric mobility management concepts from the customer perspective. Since conventional approaches and singular methods are not appropriate, we adopted a multi-method approach consisting of five parts: (1) supply concepts are developed, (2) vehicle requirements for intermodal sharing are identified, (3) intermodal trip information is collected, (4) an agent based model and a macroscopic demand model are developed further in order to represent intermodal trips and e-vehicles and to evaluate several supply concepts, and (5) the impact and acceptance of modern and flexible mobility services like carsharing, bikesharing or new electric vehicle concepts (e.g. segways or light cars) is assessed and evaluated. The proposed methodology can be used for the development of customer oriented and attractive intermodal sharing services. Hence, the model results are essential for the evaluation and economic appraisal of e-sharing services from the supplier perspective. The proposed methodology can be applied to other cities and regions.},

The amount of affordable housing produced under IZ has been modest and depends primarily on how long IZ has been in place. Results from suburban Boston suggest that IZ has contributed to increased housing prices and lower rates of production during periods of regional house price appreciation. In the San Francisco area, IZ also appears to increase housing prices in times of regional price appreciation, but to decrease prices during cooler regional markets. There is no evidence of a statistically significant effect of IZ on new housing development in the Bay Area.},

Multilevel regression analysis indicates that the role of urban form variables in the explanation of commute times is limited in comparison with micro-level personal and household characteristics. Car commute times are shown to be higher in most poly-centric systems. In addition, car commute times tend to increase with higher residential densities and with the size of daily urban systems (DUS). The results suggest that the relocation of residences and employment in the Netherlands has not by and large led to lower commute times. One reason for this might be the strong spatial planning tradition in the Netherlands.},

  abstract = {Peer-to-peer carsharing, in which ``hosts'' (i.e., vehicle owners) make their vehicles available for a fee, has grown markedly in recent years. Little is known about how activity in this sector is distributed across communities with different socioeconomic or demographic profiles, or about the income it provides to hosts. To offer insights into these issues, this study evaluates anonymized data of trips made on Turo, one of the country's largest peer-to-peer carsharing platforms, in Illinois. It shows that usage is heaviest in higher-density neighborhoods with above-average unemployment and rental housing rates, with a particularly large concentration on Chicago's near north, south, and west sides, as well as zip codes with sizable minority populations. Most transactions are financially remunerative to hosts who would own their vehicle regardless of their decision to share. When maintenance and other expenses are taken into account (while nonmonetary costs such as the host's time are excluded), 94.9\% of trips cover their marginal cost to the host. The returns from sharing sports utility vehicles (SUVs) tend to be higher than those for sedans and minivans. A low-income family making \$40,000 annually will increase household income by 6\% by sharing a vehicle 90 days annually.},

  abstract = {Innovations and technological disruptions in the ``sharing economy'' are shifting the contours of urban travel in the United States.  Carsharing organizations such as car2go and Zipcar have grown exponentially over the past decade, expanding their memberships from 52,347 in 2004 to 1,181,087 in 2015.  Ridesourcing companies like Lyft and Uber, which were entirely absent from most U.S. cities as recently as 2010, are now global powerhouses, each reportedly worth billions of dollars.  Private investors, after avoiding investments in urban transit services for more than half a century, are now offering venture capital for Bridj, Chariot, and other companies. This Article explores the dynamics of ``shared mobility'' and the policy issues facing the participants in that sector through a review of the evolution of four prominent types of shared mobility providers: (1) carsharing organizations; (2) transportation network companies such as Lyft and Uber; (3) privately operated ``microtransit'' operators; and (4) crowdsourced intercity bus lines. The analytical portion of the study in Part I describes and critiques how these sectors have evolved and summarizes the notable legal and policy issues they face. Part II develops a typology that categorizes their services and shows how each has disrupted the transportation sector. The last section also offers conclusions and suggestions for further study.},

These have, for generations, served as defining features of the city's cosmopolitan character. Showcasing great icons of transportation, including Chicago's Union Station, Dearborn Station, and Midway and O'Hare airports, as well as lesser-known and long-gone terminals throughout the metropolitan region, this book illustrates why the Windy City so richly deserves its reputation as America's premier travel hub.Featuring 48 stations and terminals through short narrative, 215 color photographs, and 20 custom maps, Terminal Town provides a fascinating portrait of the city's famously complex and constantly changing transportation system.},

  abstract = {Problem, research strategy, and findings: There are more than 400 U.S. metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) overseeing multiple transportation projects totaling billions of dollars, yet these crucial organizations and their history and current role are generally unknown or confusing to many planning practitioners and scholars. MPOs face major challenges in developing meaningful long-range regional transportation plans, challenges rooted in their history that planners should understand as they grapple with metropolitan planning efforts. MPOs may approve projects and their funding, but disparate agencies and often competitive local governments control budgets and actually build projects. MPOs, moreover, do not fully represent all regional interests and have no control over the local land use decisions that would support less autocentric communities and human-powered modes. I provide a metareview of the history of regional transportation planning and the MPOs responsible for it, describing U.S. metropolitan transportation planning from the early 20th century. Federal legislation in the 1960s first suggested a regional forum for conversations about metropolitan transportation. Federal legislation in subsequent decades made incremental if incomplete progress toward creating a meaningful regional forum, adapting institutions and practices to increase stakeholder involvement as well as the scope of transport planning, yet MPOs have multiple limitations that planners can address.Takeaway for practice: History suggests that MPOs can be a force for regional change. Planners and policymakers could anchor future reforms to MPOs' existing legal and administrative frameworks. Planners should revisit the membership and voting structures of MPO boards to ensure better stakeholder representation and permit some MPOs to generate and direct transportation funds at the local level.},

Policies need to be more inclusive of the accessibility needs of the urban poor. Change requires redesigning the existing public finance systems that support urban mobility. The aim is to diminish their embedded biases towards automobile-based travel. Through a series of chapters from international contributors, the book brings together expertise from different fields. It shows how small changes can incentivize large positive developments in urban transport and create truly accessible cities.},

Two minor interludes are also briefly examined; these are represented by behavioural geography and the so-called localities debate. It is suggested that the course of economic geography over the last half-century can best be understood by reference to the sociology of knowledge, i.e., a contextualised but reasoned description of those contextualised but reasoned descriptions that constitute scholarly practice.},

The current development is mainly influenzed by deregulation and economic liberalization. The prevailing determinant of the situation in the Namibian capital is the rapid population growth, caused by migrants from the northern part of the city, a section still disadvantaged in infrastrtucrure, services and job opportunities. Some segregative elements of the apartheid structure - such as the general layout of Katutura and the border strip - persist and the municipality is not trying tro remove them. Therefore, as elsewhere in South Africa, racial segregation is replaced by social segregation, with a growing part of poor people in the north and an economically dominant part in the central and southern sections of the city. Inside each of these two poles we find a more heterogeneous development than before.},

They incorporate a number of high-end sensors that provide many new dimensions to smartphone experience. The use of smartphones, however, can be extended from the usual telecommunication field to applications in other specialized fields including transportation. Sensors embedded in the smartphones like GPS, accelerometer and gyroscope can collect data passively, which in turn can be processed to infer the travel mode of the smartphone user. This will solve most of the shortcomings associated with conventional travel survey methods including biased response, no response, erroneous time recording, etc. The current study uses the sensors' data collected by smartphones to extract nine features for classification. Variables including data frequency, moving window size and proportion of data to be used for training, are dealt with to achieve better results. Random forest is used to classify the smartphone data among six modes. An overall accuracy of 99.96\% is achieved, with no mode less than 99.8\% for data collected at 10 Hz frequency. The accuracy is observed to decrease with decrease in data frequency, but at the same time the computation time also decreases.},

Any data recorded by the accelerometer can be successfully utilised to determine the mode of transportation in use, which will provide an alternative to conventional household travel surveys and make it possible to implement customer-oriented advertising programmes. In this study, a comparison is made between changes in pre-processing, selection methods for generating training data, and classifiers, using the accelerometer data collected from three cities in Japan. The classifiers used were support vector machines (SVM), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), decision tree and random forests. The results of this exercise suggest that using a 125-point moving average during pre-processing and selecting training data proportionally for all modes will maximise prediction accuracy. Moreover, random forests outperformed all other classifiers by yielding an overall prediction accuracy of 99.8~\% for all three cities.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Over the past fifty years, more than three hundred infectious diseases have either emerged or reemerged, appearing in places where they've never before been seen. Years before the sudden arrival of COVID-19, ninety percent of epidemiologists predicted that one of them would cause a deadly pandemic sometime in the next two generations. It might be Ebola, avian flu, a drug-resistant superbug, or something completely new, like the novel virus the world is confronting today. While it was impossible to predict the emergence of SARS-CoV-2\rule{1em}{1pt}and it remains impossible to predict which pathogen will cause the next global outbreak\rule{1em}{1pt}by unraveling the stories of pandemics past we can begin to better understand our own future, and to prepare for what it holds in store.In Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond, Sonia Shah interweaves history, original reportage, and personal narrative to explore the origins of epidemics, drawing parallels between cholera\rule{1em}{1pt}one of history's most deadly and disruptive pandemic-causing pathogens\rule{1em}{1pt}and the new diseases that stalk humankind today. She tracks each stage of cholera's dramatic journey, from its emergence in the South Asian hinterlands as a harmless microbe to its rapid dispersal across the nineteenth-century world, all the way to its latest beachhead in Haiti. Along the way she reports on the pathogens now following in cholera's footsteps, from the MRSA bacterium that besieges her own family to the never-before-seen killers coming out of China's wet markets, the surgical wards of New Delhi, and the suburban backyards of the East Coast.Delving into the convoluted science, strange politics, and checkered history of one of the world's deadliest diseases, Pandemic is a work of epidemiological history like no other, with urgent lessons for our own time.``Shah proves a disquieting Virgil, guiding us through the hells ruled by [infectious diseases] . . . the power of Shah's account lies in her ability to track simultaneously the multiple dimensions of the public-health crises we are facing.'' \rule{1em}{1pt}The Chicago Tribune},

  abstract = {Spatial distribution modeling of CO in Tehran can lead to better air pollution management and control, and it is also suitable for exposure assessment and epidemiological studies. In this study MARS (Multi\textendash variate Adaptive Regression Splines) is compared with typical interpolation techniques for spatial distribution modeling of hourly and daily CO concentrations in Tehran, Iran. The measured CO data in 2008 by 16 monitoring stations were used in this study. The Generalized Cross Validation (GCV) and Cross Validation techniques were utilized for the parameter optimization in the MARS and other techniques, respectively. Then the optimized techniques were compared based on the mean absolute of percentage error (MAPE). Although the Cokriging technique presented less MAPE than the Inverse Distance Weighting, Thin Plate Smooth Splines and Kriging techniques, MARS exhibited the least MAPE. In addition, the MARS modeling procedure is easy. Therefore, MARS has merit to be introduced as an appropriate method for spatial distribution modeling. The number of air pollution monitoring stations is very low (16 stations for 22 zones) and the distribution of stations is not suitable for spatial estimation, hence the level of errors was relatively high (more than 60\%). Consequently, hourly and daily mapping of CO provides a limited picture of spatial patterns of CO in Tehran, but it is suitable for estimation of relative CO levels in different zones of Tehran. Hence, the map of mean annual CO concentration was generated by averaging daily CO distributions in 2008. It showed that the most polluted regions in Tehran are the central, eastern and southeastern parts, and mean annual CO concentration in these parts (zones 6, 12, 13,14 and 15) is between 4.2 and 4.6 ppm.},

This is due to shortages of parking spaces within the limited land areas of the city centers in many metropolises. The parking problem becomes an integrated part of traffic planning and management. On the other hand, it is a fact that many private parking spots are available during daytime in nearby residential compound because those residents drive their cars out to work. These temporarily vacant parking lots can be efficiently utilized to meet the parking demand of other drivers who are working at nearby locations or drivers who come for shopping or other activities. This paper proposes a framework and a simple model for embracing shared use of residential parking spaces between residents and public users. The proposed shared use is a winning strategy because it maximizes the use of private resources to benefit the community as a whole. It also creates a new business model enabled by the fast-growing mobile apps in our daily lives.},

  abstract = {Since the early days of the COVID-19 crisis the scientific community has constantly been striving to shed light on various issues such as the mechanisms driving the spread of the virus, its environmental and socio-economic impacts, and necessary recovery and adaptation plans and policies. Given the high concentration of population and economic activities in cities, they are often hotspots of COVID-19 infections. Accordingly, many researchers are struggling to explore the dynamics of the pandemic in urban areas to understand impacts of COVID-19 on cities. In this study we seek to provide an overview of COVID-19 research related to cities by reviewing literature published during the first eight months after the first confirmed cases were reported in Wuhan, China. The main aims are to understand impacts of the pandemic on cities and to highlight major lessons that can be learned for post-COVID urban planning and design. Results show that, in terms of thematic focus, early research on the impacts of COVID-19 on cities is mainly related to four major themes, namely, (1) environmental quality, (2) socio-economic impacts, (3) management and governance, and (4) transportation and urban design. While this indicates a diverse research agenda, the first theme that covers issues related to air quality, meteorological parameters, and water quality is dominant, and the others are still relatively underexplored. Improvements in air and water quality in cities during lockdown periods highlight the significant environmental impacts of anthropogenic activities and provide a wake-up call to adopt environmentally friendly development pathways. The paper also provides other recommendations related to the socio-economic factors, urban management and governance, and transportation and urban design that can be used for post-COVID urban planning and design. Overall, existing knowledge shows that the COVID-19 crisis entails an excellent opportunity for planners and policy makers to take transformative actions towards creating cities that are more just, resilient, and sustainable.},

A technique for identifying transportation-disadvantaged populations, intended for use by local practitioners and designed with their skills and professional routines in mind, was piloted in five rural counties in North Carolina. Maps showing areas of elevated theoretical risk of transportation disadvantage were constructed by overlaying layers of readily available, Census-based geospatial data, to generate composite maps where increasing intensity of shading denotes populations with multiple risk factors. The maps were used in key informant interviews with local transportation-relevant professionals to access their expert knowledge, and in focus groups with non-expert residents to probe their travel routines and need to access essential goods, services and activities. These multiple data sources supported an iterative process of initial mapping, stakeholder outreach, revised mapping, and continued discussion. Our findings both corroborated some a priori expectations, and yielded unexpected insights into which residents may experience transportation disadvantage and how they respond. The work demonstrates how local knowledge can be used to identify unique or non-spatial components of transportation disadvantage, and underscores the importance of locally specific knowledge to support planning efforts to identify and ultimately to address transportation disadvantage.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem stresses induced by global warming, water supply shortages, fisheries depletion and deforestation continue to threaten our planet. At the same time, considerations of social justice impel us to accelerate the rate of economic development in order to raise the living standards of the four billion people around the world whose per capita income is less than a tenth of that of the US.  Failure to meet this rising demand is not only a moral failure, but will almost certainly lead to detrimental social, political and medical consequences for the developed world. The logic of sustainability as an overall positive contributor to the economic bottom line is consistent with the mutually supporting goals of elimination of poverty and closing the income gap between rich and poor populations. Fundamental changes are required, however, in the way that customer demands are satisfied, and these changes will have to come from both new technologies and new business models.  This paper discusses the role of information technology in achieving a sustainable economy with an emphasis on the developing world. It will also examine how Internet-enabled e-services may represent these new sustainable technologies and business models, and provides some examples of how Hewlett-Packard Co.

  abstract = {National level statistics show a decade-long decline in the use of cars in the United States as well as other developed countries. This transition has been connected to growth in more sustainable forms of urban transport such as walking, bicycling, and increased use of transit, as well as changes in urban spatial planning. This article examines the recent trends toward more sustainable mobility in Philadelphia, in order to locate these cultural changes in a specific spatial, cultural, and racial context. The article raises the crucial yet often ignored issue of how urban spatial form and mobility regimes in post-industrial cities like Philadelphia are highly inflected by racial space and racialized mobilities. It suggests that wider trends toward decreasing young white automobility in cities across the U.S. must be situated in relation to changing patterns of suburbanization of poverty, gentrification of city centers, and struggles over public transit access and investment. The specific case is analyzed in relation to multi-level transition theories, cultural analysis of mobility frames and discourses, and the addition of local observation of everyday transport drawing on perspectives from mobilities research. A focus on racial space and transport inequality adds new insights to understanding the limits of any transition that may be taking place in the American automobility regime, and it expands how such transitions are being culturally framed and promoted.},

Research on the sustainability of evidence-based interventions has been growing rapidly. Sustainability has been defined as the continued use of program components at sufficient intensity for the sustained achievement of desirable program goals and population outcomes. This understudied area has been identified as one of the most significant translational research problems. Adding to this challenge is uncertainty regarding the extent to which intervention adaptation and evolution are necessary to address the needs of populations that differ from those in which interventions were originally tested or implemented. This review critically examines and discusses conceptual and methodological issues in studying sustainability, summarizes the multilevel factors that have been found to influence the sustainability of interventions in a range of public health and health care settings, and highlights key areas for future research.},

  abstract = {The growth of peer-to-peer markets has provided a mechanism through which private individuals can enter a market as small scale, often temporary, suppliers of a good or service. Companies that facilitate this type of supply have attracted controversy in cities around the world, with concerns regarding Uber and Airbnb in particular. Both companies have been subject to criticism for failing to pay taxes to local authorities and for avoiding regulatory oversight that constrains more traditional suppliers of these services. It is not surprising that these companies have been criticized by more traditional suppliers of short term accommodation or transportation as presenting unfair competition, and attempts have been made to ban provision of these services in several cities around the world. A central complaint concerning Airbnb focuses on the impact of short-term rental properties on the value of residential property. A report prepared by the Office of the Attorney General of the State of New York lists these impacts among a number of concerns: do Airbnb rentals provide a black market in unsafe hotels? Do short-term rentals make New York City less affordable? Is the influx of out-of-town visitors upsetting the quiet of longstanding residential neighborhoods? These concerns pose difficulties because they imply different impacts on the values of residential properties. If short-term rentals provided via Airbnb create a concentration of what are effectively unsafe hotels, upsetting quiet residential neighborhoods, they would generate a local concentration of externalities that might be expected to depress property values rather than make housing less affordable. Alternatively, if these externality effects are modest relative to the impacts of space diverted from providing housing for residents to providing short-term accommodation for visitors, then local concentration of Airbnb properties may increase house prices. Perhaps because of this confusion, it is possible to find divergent viewpoints expressed about the impacts of Airbnb in the popular press and in consultant reports, but (to our knowledge) no careful study that estimates the direct impact of Airbnb rental availability on house prices. This paper presents such a study in the context of New York City.},

The authors consider how the social isolation of urban blacks increases black violence.

In contrast to previous research, which employs the index of dissimilarity (D) as a default indicator of segregation (which it is not), we measure the spatial isolation (P) of blacks from whites. Black isolation emerges as a strong predictor of the rates of black violence in major US cities, a finding that may account for prior evidence of a link between segregation and violence at the macro level.},

Because the spread city was encouraged by public policy, and did not just happen, the author argues that public policy can also recentralise the city. Three steps are needed: regulate development on vacant land; organise consortia of investors and employers to move together into old cities; and intensify and systematise efforts to bring long-term households into the above-ground economy. -A.Gilg},

By reducing the market price of parking, minimum parking requirements provide subsidies that inflate parking demand, and this inflated demand is then used to set minimum parking requirements. When considered as an impact fee, minimum parking requirements can increase development costs by more than 10 times the impact fees for all other public purposes combined. Eliminating minimum parking requirements would reduce the cost of urban development, improve urban design, reduce automobile dependency, and restrain urban sprawl.},

  abstract = {The study of racial segregation has long been an important theme in urban geography, encompassing a broad range of topics, from static racial patterns to the emphasis on race as a political and social construction. The present study takes a broader approach, focusing upon the changing contexts (national and metropolitan) within which a city's urban racial patterns evolve. More specifically, this paper (a) raises some questions concerning the nature and assum;ptions of some of the segregation literature, (b) looks at the changing racial patterns of one city, Detroit, in terms of their social and historical context, and (c) considers some of the social implications of the contemporary spatial pattern of race within the metropolis. The postwar spatial pattern of Detroit's black population can be divided into four distinct periods, described as (a) spatial confinement, (b) spatial release, (c) spatial stability, and (d) spatial diversity. The racial pattern in each period is placed in its local and national context, and related to broader contemporary socioeconomic processes and problems which are molding the metropolitan landscape. In the 1990s, these problems are quite different, but no less severe than in the past, and might well include a spatial division within the metropolitan black community itself.},

A sample of approximately 50,000 adults in two-earner households in urban areas distributed across the United States is selected from public use microdata from the 1980 census and used to estimate a simultaneous model to explain commute to work behavior of men and women. The model is estimated separately for households that did and did not change residences in the past year. The impacts of the new residences on the commute times of both male and female workers, holding other variables constant, are compared. We conclude that residential selection does favor males relative to females, although there is evidence that this advantage is eliminated as the ratio of female to male earnings in the same household narrows.},

  abstract = {Bike sharing systems consist of a fleet of bikes placed in a network of docking stations. These bikes can then be rented and returned to any of the docking stations after usage. Pre-dicting unrealized bike demand at locations currently without bike stations is important for effectively designing and ex-panding bike sharing systems. We predict pairwise bike de-mand for New York City's Citi Bike system. Since the system is driven by daily commuters we focus only on the morning rush hours between 7:00 AM to 11:00 AM during weekdays. We use taxi usage, weather and spatial variables as covari-ates to predict bike demand, and further analyze the influence of precipitation and day of week. We show that aggregating stations in neighborhoods can substantially improve predic-tions. The presented model can assist planners by predicting bike demand at a macroscopic level, between pairs of neigh-borhoods.},

  abstract = {We present a pragmatic approach to assist planners in addressing racial inequities in park access. Utilizing the Los Angeles metropolitan region as an example, we used Thiessen polygons to delineate a service area for each park, and described potential park congestion or 'pressure' in each park service area. Results show that Latinos, African-Americans, and low-income groups in general were likely to live close to parks with higher potential park congestion. On the other hand, predominantly White, high-income areas were typically located close to parks with lower potential park congestion levels. The park service area analysis presented here facilitates the identification of areas with greater park need and provides a pragmatic way to redress existing disparities in park access. Built into a set of web-based decision support tools, the approach fosters greater community participation and empowers local stakeholders in the process of park provision. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

But this new wave of technology companies is funded and steered by very old-school venture capitalists. And in Whats Yours Is Mine, technologist Tom Slee argues the so-called sharing economy damages development, extends harsh free-market practices into previously protected areas of our lives, and presents the opportunity for a few people to make fortunes by damaging communities and pushing vulnerable individuals to take on unsustainable risk. Drawing on original empirical research, Slee shows that the friendly language of sharing, trust, and community masks a darker reality.},

  abstract = {Background Previous work suggests that children who use active modes of travel (walking or cycling) are more physically active overall than those who use motorised transport (car, bus or train). However, the majority of these studies used cross-sectional designs, and it is not known whether a shift in mode of travel to school is associated with a change in children's overall physical activity. Objective To investigate the relationship between changes in mode of travel to school and changes in overall physical activity among children aged 9-10 years over a 1-year period. Method We used data collected in the SPEEDY study, a population-based cohort study examining factors associated with physical activity among primary school children in Norfolk, UK. Baseline data collection took place during the summer term of 2007, with follow-up exactly 1 year later. Usual mode of travel to school (car, bus or train, bike, or on foot) was self-reported at both time points. Physical activity was measured using Actigraph accelerometers worn for one week. Only children with three or more valid days of accelerometer wear ({$\geq$}500 min/day) at both baseline and follow-up were included in analysis. Accelerometer data were summarised as time (min/day) spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA, defined as {$>$}2000 accelerometer counts/min). Two-level multiple linear regression models stratified by sex were used to explore associations between change in travel mode and change in MVPA after adjustment for sociodemographic and locational characteristics. Results 813 students, 47\% of whom were boys, provided valid data at both time points. 50 (6\%) students reported a change from active to motorised travel, 75 (9\%) reported a change from motorised to active travel, and 688 (85\%) reported no change in their usual mode of travel. Compared with those who reported no change, a shift from motorised to active travel was associated with an increase in daily time spent in MVPA ({$\beta$}=12.96, 95\% CI 6.29 to 19.63). This equated to an estimated mean difference of 9 min/day (SD =31) of MVPA in boys and 6 min/day (sd=29) in girls. No significant change in MVPA was observed in those who shifted from active to motorised travel ({$\beta$}=-4.81, 95\% CI -12.91 to 3.29). Conclusion Taking up active travel to school is associated with an increase in overall physical activity in primary school children. Promoting active travel to school may therefore contribute to increasing physical activity in this age group.},

We developed a decision support system (DSS) for TMDL compliance at the city level to solve for a phased, least-cost strategy toward meeting four TMDLs using stormwater filtration. Based on a case-study city, we modeled wet weather flows and associated discharge of Total Suspended Sediment (TSS), cadmium, copper, and zinc to receiving waters by coupling U.S. EPA's Storm Water Management Model (SWMM v. 5.0) with the geographic dataset of the urban drainage network. We linked a mixed integer linear programming algorithm to the watershed model for deriving cost-effective selection and placement of curb inlet filters to meet mass- and concentration-based TMDL requirements. The least cost solution for meeting the city's TMDL waste load allocations for TSS (73.9\% reduction), Cd (50.6\% reduction), Cu (30.0\% reduction), and Zn (55.7\% reduction) would require 1071 filter inserts at a cost of \$1.7 million. In contrast, random placement of 1071 filters or uniform placement of 1266 filters is effective only for TSS and would cost \$4.0 million and \$4.8 million, respectively. Our results demonstrate the increases in cost-effectiveness of using an optimization-based DSS for urban watershed management.},

In the following review, a range of factors which may influence the design and construction as well as the occupation of an environmental setting for people with acquired brain injury ( ABI), are described. During a person's rehabilitation, the environment may support his or her protection, while simultaneously promoting independence and learning. In a discussion regarding the design of built environments for people with ABI, medical, or allied health perspectives usually dominate. To design settings that support these objectives, the designer perspectives, be they interior, architectural, or landscape, must be identified. Typically, designers and architects do not adopt a linear approach to creating environments, but rather they integrate what Nigel Cross calls a designerly way of knowing. A designer-stance may broaden possibilities while supporting the appropriate models of care or philosophy of rehabilitation. The aim of this review is to map and summarize the breadth of current literature that involves or could inform the design of facilities for people with ABI. Such a review is necessary to consolidate what is known, in order to build upon it. The overall aim is to inform design professionals of the breadth of considerations when designing for people with ABI. In addition, it will inform managers, carers and allied health professionals of current understandings. Conceptualizations from different disciplinary perspectives of designing for rehabilitation of people with ABI are discussed.},

  abstract = {State-of-the-art airborne SAR sensors provide high-resolution ground mapping data. This offers the opportunity of using this technology for the analysis of built-up areas. However, especially at building locations different SAR specific phenomena like layover, shadow, and multipath-propagation burden the interpretation of the SAR imagery even for experts. In order to consider such effects in the analysis and the geocoding of SAR data, high-resolution information about the 3D structure of the urban scene is required. Three dimensional elevation data from a GIS can be provided in different representations, like DEM (raster data) or city models (vector data). In this paper, the benefit of GIS data for the SAR mission planning and the analysis of acquired SAR data are discussed. For the first task, the SAR acquisition parameters are optimized a priori with respect to the best mapping of a local area or a certain object class. For this optimization, a large number of simulations with systematically varying aspect and viewing angles are carried out. For the second task, the 2D and 3D context information are fused with the acquired SAR imagery to support the interpretation for a change detection task. Additionally, simulated features of man-made objects are offered to the image interpreter for comparison with the data. The feasibility of different kinds of GIS data for these purposes is discussed.},

This unique textbook emphasizes a holistic approach to community building that combines business and real-estate development with a focus on stimulating family self-reliance and community empowerment. The result is an innovative approach to rehabilitating communities in decline while preserving resident demographics. The authors delve deep into the social, political, human, and financial capital involved in effecting change and how race and regional issues can complicate approaches and outcomes. Throughout, they integrate case examples to illustrate their strategies and conclude with a consideration of the critical role social workers can play in developing CED's next phase.},

Because COVID-19 is extremely transmissible and can progress to a severe form of respiratory failure, the potential to overwhelm available critical care resources is high and critical care management of COVID-19 patients has been thrust into the spotlight. COVID-19 arrived in the United States in January and, as anticipated, has dramatically increased the usage of critical care resources. Three of the hardest-hit cities have been Seattle, New York City, and Chicago with a combined total of over 14,000 cases as of March 23, 2020., In this special article, we describe initial clinical impressions of critical care of COVID-19 in these areas, with attention to clinical presentation, laboratory values, organ system effects, treatment strategies, and resource management. We highlight clinical observations that align with or differ from already published reports. These impressions represent only the early empiric experience of the authors and are not intended to serve as recommendations or guidelines for practice, but rather as a starting point for intensivists preparing to address COVID-19 when it arrives in their community.},

While separate studies have examined various factors affecting consumers' adoption of Airbnb, the literature has largely focused on a handful of factors in isolation. Adopting a sequential mixed-methods approach, this study proposes a comprehensive conceptual model integrating the literature and findings of a qualitative study and subsequently tests the model via a national survey. The results suggest that, for motivations, price value, enjoyment, and home benefits significantly explain overall attitude toward Airbnb. As for constraints, distrust is the only factor that significantly predicts overall attitude, while insecurity is directly related to behavioral intentions. Overall attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms, such as social influence and trend affinity, predict behavioral intentions. This study contributes to the literature by simultaneously examining the predictive power of both motivations and constraints of Airbnb consumers in explaining overall attitude and purchase behavior.},

The most commonly used measure, size of opportunity weighted by the reciprocal of distance, is not statistically surpassed by any other measures. Cumulative opportunity within the average commuting distance and the distance to the central business district are the poorest accessibility measures.},

Rather than viewing alternative and conventional food networks as separate spheres, we see them as highly competitive and as relational to one another and argue for the need to examine the links more critically. In particular, we highlight the need to explore the competitive relationships that alternative food networks have with the conventional sector to expose power imbalances and the effect these may have on wider rural development processes.},

Many of these models are three-dimensional, and increasingly there is a move towards real-time presentation of such large models. We present an algorithm for generating consistent 3D models from a combination of data sources, including Ordnance Survey ground plans, aerial photography and laser height data. Although there have been several demonstrations of automatic generation of building models from 2D vector map data, we present a very robust solution that generates models that are suitable for real-time presentation. We then demonstrate a novel pollution visualization that uses these models},

  abstract = {The interpretation of patient scores on clinical tests of physical mobility is limited by a lack of data describing the range of performance among people without disabilities. The purpose of this study was to provide data for 4 common clinical tests in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Ninety-six community-dwelling elderly people (61-89 years of age) with independent functioning performed 4 clinical tests. Data were collected on the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MW), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), and Timed Up \& Go Test (TUG) and during comfortable- and fast-speed walking (CGS and FGS). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine the test-retest reliability for the 6MW, TUG, CGS, and FGS measurements. Data were analyzed by gender and age (60-69, 70-79, and 80-89 years) cohorts, similar to previous studies. Means, standard deviations, and 95\% confidence intervals for each measurement were calculated for each cohort. The 6MW, TUG, CGS, and FGS measurements showed high test-retest reliability (ICC [2,1]=.95-.97). Mean test scores showed a trend of age-related declines for the 6MW, BBS, TUG, CGS, and FGS for both male and female subjects. Preliminary descriptive data suggest that physical therapists should use age-related data when interpreting patient data obtained for the 6MW, BBS, TUG, CGS and FGS. Further data on these clinical tests with larger sample sizes are needed to serve as a reference for patient comparisons.},

  abstract = {Distance is a variable of pivotal importance in transport studies. Therefore, after checking the validity of a potential criterion method for measuring active commuting route distances, this method was used to assess the validity and reproducibility of four methods of approximating the commuting route distances covered by pedestrians and bicyclists. The methods assessed were: self-estimated distance, straight-line distance, GIS shortest-route distance, and GPS-measured distance. For this purpose, participants were recruited when walking or bicycling in Stockholm, Sweden. Questionnaires and individually-adjusted maps were sent twice to 133 participants. The distances of map-drawn commuting routes functioned as criterion distances. The participants were also asked to estimate their distances. The straight-line distance between origin and destination was measured using map-drawn routes. The shortest route between home addresses and workplace addresses was calculated with three GIS algorithms. Eighty-six trips were measured with GPS. The main results were that test\textendash retest intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) exceeded 0.99 for all methods, except for self-estimated distance (ICC = 0.76). No order effects existed between test and retest. Significant differences were, however, noted between criterion distance and self-estimated distance (114 {$\pm$} 63\%), straight-line distance (79.1 {$\pm$} 10.5\%), GIS shortest route (112 {$\pm$} 18\% to 121 {$\pm$} 22\%) and GPS distance (105 {$\pm$} 4\%). We conclude that commonly-used distance estimation methods produce systematic errors of differing magnitudes when used in a context of active commuting in suburban and urban environments. These errors can at average level be corrected for, whereas individual relative errors will remain.},

Lewin's (1951) concept of action research highlights the scientific and societal value of translating psychological research into community problem-solving strategies. Implicit in Lewin's formulation is the importance of achieving effective collaboration among behavioral researchers, community members and policy makers. The present analysis builds on Lewin's analysis by outlining programmatic directions for the scientific study of transdisciplinary research and community action. Three types of collaboration, and the contextual circumstances that facilitate or hinder them, are examined: (1) collaboration among scholars representing different disciplines; (2) collaboration among researchers from multiple fields and community practitioners representing diverse professional and lay perspectives; and (3) collaboration among community organizations across local, state, national, and international levels. In the present analysis, transdisciplinary action research is viewed as a topic of scientific study in its own right to achieve a more complete understanding of prior collaborations and to identify strategies for refining and sustaining future collaborations (and their intended outcomes) among researchers, community members and organizations.},

  abstract = {Social Ecology in the Digital Age: Solving Complex Problems in a Globalized World provides a comprehensive overview of social ecological theory, research, and practice. Written by renowned expert Daniel Stokols, the book distills key principles from diverse strands of ecological science, offering a robust framework for transdisciplinary research and societal problem-solving. The existential challenges of the 21st Century - global climate change and climate-change denial, environmental pollution, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, disease pandemics, inter-ethnic violence and the threat of nuclear war, cybercrime, the Digital Divide, and extreme poverty and income inequality confronting billions each day - cannot be understood and managed adequately from narrow~disciplinary or political perspectives. Social Ecology in the Digital Age is grounded in scientific research but written in a personal and informal style from the vantage point of a former student, current teacher and scholar who has contributed over four decades to the field of social ecology. The book will be of interest to scholars, students, educators, government leaders and community practitioners working in several fields including social and human ecology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, criminology, law, education, biology, medicine, public health, earth system and sustainability science, geography, environmental design, urban planning, informatics, public policy and global governance.

Using data primarily from the 1990 and 2000 US censuses, and the 1994 and 1999 US Department of Commerce's zip code business pattern files, descriptive, multivariate and decompositional evidence is generated to address why Blacks and to a lesser extent Latinos display greater degrees of spatial mismatch than Whites. The results indicate that, among many other factors including job sprawl, racial segregation in housing markets is the most important. The models indicate that racial differences in spatial mismatch conditions, particularly between Blacks and Whites, should be eliminated in 45\textendash 50 years if racial segregation levels continue to decline in the future at rates similar to those observed over the 1990s.},

  abstract = {The analysis of many physical and engineering problems involves running complex computational models (simulation models, computer codes). With problems of this type, it is important to understand the relationships between the input variables (whose values are often imprecisely known) and the output. The goal of sensitivity analysis (SA) is to study this relationship and identify the most significant factors or variables affecting the results of the model. In this presentation, an improvement on existing methods for SA of complex computer models is described for use when the model is too computationally expensive for a standard Monte-Carlo analysis. In these situations, a meta-model or surrogate model can be used to estimate the necessary sensitivity index for each input. A sensitivity index is a measure of the variance in the response that is due to the uncertainty in an input. Most existing approaches to this problem either do not work well with a large number of input variables and/or they ignore the error involved in estimating a sensitivity index. Here, a new approach to sensitivity index estimation using meta-models and bootstrap confidence intervals is described that provides solutions to these drawbacks. Further, an efficient yet effective approach to incorporate this methodology into an actual SA is presented. Several simulated and real examples illustrate the utility of this approach. This framework can be extended to uncertainty analysis as well.},

  abstract = {Car-sharing is a precursor to the emerging class of ``mobility services'' leveraging modern technology to enable access to car-based mobility without the consumer owning the physical asset. Consequently, it plays an increasingly important role for urban mobility. Two-way station-based systems, where the customer picks up and returns a car at a single designated station, are the most common type of car-sharing solution. While these systems are most common in practice, they have attracted limited research activity from the optimization community. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the potentials of spatial and temporal customer flexibility to achieve better supply-demand alignment. To this end, we assess both the value and the cost of customer flexibility. Using a real-world data set with over 50,000 car-sharing reservations from a midsized German city, we assess the potential benefits of customer flexibility under offline and online optimization. The offline results indicate that temporal flexibility has only very limited potentials for fleet size reductions (4\% reduction at four hours' flexibility). At the same time, spatial flexibility is highly valuable\textemdash customer flexibility of 1 kilometer facilitates a fleet reduction of 12\%. Furthermore, we find that spatial and temporal flexibility are highly complementary, with 750 meters and 3 hours yielding reduction potentials of almost 20\%. The viability of the potentials is confirmed in the online setting with this reduced fleet. To assess customer willingness to provide flexibility, we conducted a basic discrete choice experiment with 1,529 car-sharing customers. We find that several customers are likely to offer flexibility in time or space for relatively little compensation. These estimates are then used as an input to an expanded fleet optimization problem. These results provide novel insights into the benefits and costs of leveraging consumer flexibility in car-sharing schemes. They are of particular relevance for car-sharing service providers and communities that aim to efficiently bridge the gap between individual and public transportation, and to inform urban transportation policy.The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2017.0813.},

He challenges the conventional wisdom that urban decline is the product of the social programs and racial fissures of the 1960s. Weaving together the history of workplaces, unions, civil rights groups, political organizations, and real estate agencies, Sugrue finds the roots of today's urban poverty in a hidden history of racial violence, discrimination, and deindustrialization that reshaped the American urban landscape after World War II.This Princeton Classics edition includes a new preface by Sugrue, discussing the lasting impact of the postwar transformation on urban America and the chronic issues leading to Detroit's bankruptcy.},

  abstract = {Commuting is the major source of congestion and air pollution in the United States. For almost a decade, urban policy-makers have been concerned about the geographical balance between locations of jobs and housing as a strategy for reducing traffic congestion and air pollution in American cities. Despite the popularity and apparent acceptance of the job/housing (J/H) imbalance concept among public policy-makers, little empirical research has been done on the J/H imbalance and how it relates to commuting patterns. This research examines commuting patterns in the Atlanta metropolitan area to determine the extent to which commuting flow volume is the result of an imbalance between the location of home and workplace by using the most sophisticated and largest geographical scale data provided by the 1990 U.S. Census of Transportation Planning Package. This paper uses a Geographic Information System (GIS) to measure the job/housing imbalance within a commuting catchment area having a 7-mile radius from the centroid of each Transportation Analysis Zone. Analysis of variance, stepwise multiple regression and cartographic evidence all confirm the relationship between the imbalance of jobs and housing (J/H) and mean travel time to work. This investigation highlights the fact that the imbalance between the location of jobs and housing is the most important determinant for longer commuting and suggests that higher quality housing growth close to the job-rich communities may benefit the workers to economize the commuting time.},

  abstract = {This study documents how residential segregation is visible in social interactions in the (semi) public space of the red line L-train in Chicago. While public spaces are often celebrated as spaces of cosmopolitanism, people tend to interact mainly with people who look similar and appear to be living in the same area in Chicago. People of different race and class, represented by the station where they board the train, do not encounter each other much in the L-train because of the existing residential segregation in the city of Chicago. Blacks ride from the south to downtown while whites ride from the north to downtown. Different time frames are reserved for different people. Furthermore, on the train itself people prefer to be interacting with and sit next to people who appear alike; who seem to be from the same part of the city. Hence, I argue that social interactions on the subway are mainly an expression of geographical and social exclusion in the city. Residential segregation is visible in the ``segregation of social interactions'' in the red line L-train. Consequently, while de jure segregation has been abolished in the 1960s in Chicago, segregating practices are still going on de facto in everyday life.},

  abstract = {Geographical and political research on urban service delivery - who benefits and why - has proliferated during the past two decades. Overall, this literature is not characterized by a particular attention to the importance of method in drawing conclusions about spatial equity based on empirical studies. Specifically, there has been scant interest in the effect of geographic methodology on assessing the relationship between access and socioeconomic characteristics that are spatially defined. In this paper we take a spatial analytical perspective to evaluate the importance of methodology in assessing whether or not, or to what degree, the distribution of urban public services is equitable. We approach this issue by means of an empirical case study of the spatial distribution of playgrounds in Tulsa, Oklahoma, relative to that of the targeted constituencies (children) and other socioeconomic indicators. In addition to the 'traditional' measure (count of facilities in an areal unit), we consider a potential measure (based on the gravity model), average travel distance, and distance to the nearest playground as indicators of accessibility. We find significant differences between the spatial patterns in these measures that are suggested by local indicators of spatial association and other techniques of exploratory spatial data analysis. The choice of access measure not only implies a particular treatment of spatial externalities but also affects conclusions about the existence of spatial mismatch and inequality.},

This paper investigates six socially diverse neighbourhoods in Chicago from the perspective of the residents who live there.

Six neighbourhoods in Cook County were selected that are simultaneously diverse along four dimensions: age, income, family type and race/ ethnicity. From February to June 2006, tape-recorded interviews were conducted of 85 residents in the six neighbourhoods identified as being highly diverse on multiple dimensions. Residents were surveyed about their familiarity with, and opinions about, social diversity, in addition to questions designed to probe their feelings about the importance of place and neighbourhood context.},

Thinking in these terms may also help planners adopt a particular language about diversity that is sensitive to the unique requirements of diverse places. A framework for evaluating the socially diverse neighbourhood from a design standpoint is suggested. Two sources are used: urban and community design that is specifically meant to create places that support social diversity; and ecological principles that are meant to improve the relationship between habitat and species diversity. This framework is applied to an evaluation of diverse areas in the city of Chicago and its surrounding suburbs. A multi-dimensional definition of diversity that includes income, race/ethnicity, age and family type is used. Forty-nine block groups satisfied the condition of being highly diverse in all four categories. It was found that these areas were mostly inner-ring, `blue-collar' suburbs, often having the physical characteristics of strong edges, grids with commercial corridors and mixed housing types.},

Also known as ``tactical,'' ``pop-up,'' or ``guerilla'' urbanism, this brand of urban intervention is resident-generated, low budget, and often designed to be temporary. The approach is distinguished by being in direct opposition to top-down, capital-intensive, and bureaucratically sanctioned urban change of the kind most often associated with urban planning. The purpose of this article is to review the broader, historical rootedness of these efforts. DIY urbanism has been energized by a recession and a ``right to the city'' spirit of guerrilla tactics, but it is actually rooted in a deeper tradition of nineteenth-century civic engagement. Focusing on the American experience, I show that the idea of bottom-up, tactical, DIY urbanism forms an essential tradition in American urbanism, an impulse that runs counter to the narrative of urban abandonment, and as such forms an essential platform upon which notions of any ``back to the city'' movement draw support.},

First, I find that different types of neighborhood-level social diversity have different spatial patterns, and thus may require different supportive planning strategies. Second, an increase in density predicts an increase in social diversity, but only up to a point. Third, providing varied housing unit types is an important means for promoting diversity, but offering a variety of housing values and choice between renting and owning is also important. Fourth, older urban and pre- World War II suburban areas are the most socially diverse places in the Chicago area. This may be a strength of first-tier suburbs that deserves more attention. Finally, the diversity of any residential area is in constant flux. Planners interested in sustaining diversity should focus in particular on areas where it is in decline.},

These measures are selected because they are continuous, nonnegative, equal to 0 if and only if |p1 - p2|~=~0, and maximal when |p1 - p2|~=~1. They are also symmetrical [d(p1, p2)~=~d(p2, p1)] and complement-invariant [d(p1, p2)~=~d(1 - p2, 1 - p1)]. To study intermeasure agreement, 5 of the 11 measures, including the absolute difference, are retained, because they remain finite and are maximal if and only if |p1 - p2|~=~1. Even when the 2 proportions are assumed to be drawn at random from a shared distribution-interpreted as the absence of an avoidable difference-the expected value of d(p1, p2) depends on the shape of the distribution (and the choice of d) and can be quite large. To allow for direct comparisons among measures, we propose a standard measurement unit akin to a z score. For skewed underlying beta distributions, 4 of the 5 retained measures, once standardized, offer more conservative assessments of the magnitude of inequality than the absolute difference. We conclude that, even for measures that share the highlighted mathematical properties, magnitude comparisons are most usefully assessed relative to an elicited or estimated underlying distribution for the 2 proportions.},

Studies that focus on walkability usually use available street networks that do not include pedestrian-only facilities. The effect of missing pedestrian connections where the street network is richer than the pedestrian network has been examined in some studies, but the case of suburban environments with robust pedestrian networks has mostly been ignored. In the current study, various measures of connectivity and accessibility were compared between the pedestrian network and the street network in different suburban settings and for accessibility to different land use activities, such as schools and retail centers. Documenting the degree to which the pedestrian network enhanced pedestrian accessibility over the street network alone was motivated by the desire to inform research and to inform policy. Nine neighborhoods in the city of Davis, California, with typical suburban densities, a variety of street network types, and an extensive system of off-street bicycle and pedestrian facilities were used in the study. A network that included all minor and primary roads in the city plus pedestrian ways was also used. This network included 60 mi of off-street facilities and excluded freeways not open to pedestrians. Households were used as origins and schools and retail centers as destinations to demonstrate the effect of the pedestrian network on connectivity and accessibility in different parts of the city. The results of this study can be used to improve the measurement of built environment in studies of active travel and to increase understanding of the effect of the pedestrian network in the suburban environment.},

  abstract = {In this paper, using longitudinal data on route level monthly average weekday ridership in the entire Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) bus system from January 2002 through December 2010, we evaluate the ridership effects of the CTA real-time bus information system. This bus information system is called CTA Bus Tracker and was incrementally implemented on different CTA bus routes from August 2006 to May 2009. To take account of other factors that might affect bus ridership, we also include data on unemployment levels, gas prices, local weather conditions, transit service attributes, and socioeconomic characteristics during the study period. This combined longitudinal data source enables us to implement a quasi-experimental design with statistical controls to examine changes in monthly average weekday ridership, before and after the Bus Tracker system was implemented, on each bus route. Based on a linear mixed model, we found that the provision of Bus Tracker service does increase CTA bus ridership, although the average increase is modest. Further, the study findings suggest that there are temporal variations of the ridership effects among the routes, with the ``winning'' routes more likely to have the technology implemented in the later phases of the overall ``roll-out'' period. However, the results are less conclusive regarding geographical variations in the effects of Bus Tracker.},

It is well-known that the estimation of this number may vary due to several methodological issues, including different assumptions and choice of parameters, utilized models, used datasets and estimation period. With the spreading of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, the reproduction number has been found to vary, reflecting the dynamics of transmission of the coronavirus outbreak as well as the case reporting rate. Due to significant variations in the control strategies, which have been changing over time, and thanks to the introduction of detection technologies that have been rapidly improved, enabling to shorten the time from infection/symptoms onset to diagnosis, leading to faster confirmation of the new coronavirus cases, our previous estimations on the transmission risk of the 2019-nCoV need to be revised. By using time-dependent contact and diagnose rates, we refit our previously proposed dynamics transmission model to the data available until January 29th, 2020 and re-estimated the effective daily reproduction ratio that better quantifies the evolution of the interventions. We estimated when the effective daily reproduction ratio has fallen below 1 and when the epidemics will peak. Our updated findings suggest that the best measure is persistent and strict self-isolation. The epidemics will continue to grow, and can peak soon with the peak time depending highly on the public health interventions practically implemented.},

Accessibility scores were found to be heterogeneous across geographic regions and among different groups of people. In particular, many rural areas were in a testing desert. While people in larger cities tended to have better accessibility to testing, many did not have adequate accessibility at that time due to both capacity limitations and spatial factors. In particular, people without access to private vehicles and the elderly faced disadvantages in accessibility to testing sites even in urban areas. However, Black and low-income groups were disproportionally concentrated in neighbourhoods with above-average accessibility due to their closer proximity to testing sites. These results suggest that increased efforts are needed to reach vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those without private vehicles.},

We do this by examining the experience of mandated collaborative transportation planning among state departments of transportation (DOTs) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in the USA following a significant change to national surface transportation policy in the early 1990s. To understand how state transport planning and plans changed following the inter-jurisdictional collaboration mandated by passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), we examine recent statewide transport planning in 14 of the largest US states and conducted interviews with 66 state and regional planners. We find that, despite the myriad topics that state DOTs tried to include within their comprehensive statewide plans, these plans have had, at best, a limited influence on metropolitan transport planning and activities. Despite this, we find that the mandated collaborative planning did help to increase inter-agency coordination on issues (1) where network or environmental externalities transcend regional boundaries, (2) that require the political clout of a higher-level governmental authority to enforce locally unpopular decisions, or (3) that take advantage of institutional economies of scale.},

  abstract = {Although always a part of city life, urban agriculture has recently attracted increased attention from diverse groups in the United States, which promote it as a strategy for stimulating economic development, increasing food security and access, and combatting obesity and diabetes, among other goals. Developing effective policies and programs at the city or neighborhood level demands as a first step the accurate mapping of existing urban agriculture sites. Mapping efforts in major U.S. cities have been limited in their focus and methodology. Focusing on public sites of food production, such as community gardens, they have overlooked the actual and potential contribution of private spaces, including home food gardens, to local food systems. This paper describes a case study of urban agriculture in Chicago which used the manual analysis of high-resolution aerial images in Google Earth in conjunction with ArcGIS to identify and map public and private spaces of food production. The resulting spatial dataset demonstrates that urban agriculture is an extensive land use type with wide variations in the distribution of sites across the city. Only 13\% of sites reported to be community gardening projects by nongovernment organizations and government agencies were determined, through image analysis, to be sites of food production. The production area of home gardens identified by the study is almost threefold that of community gardens. Study results suggest opportunities may exist for scaling up existing production networks\textemdash including home food gardens\textemdash and enhancing community food sovereignty by leveraging local knowledges of urban agriculture.},

Overall, the commuting patterns of white and minority workers appear to be converging rather than diverging over time, even among low-skilled workers. Contrary to the spatial mismatch hypothesis, black and Hispanic workers living in minority areas had both shorter commuting distances and commuting distances that increased more slowly between 1977-78 and 1985 compared to workers in other areas. Further, a longitudinal analysis shows that the average commuting times of non-moving minority workers in predominantly minority areas decreased during the study period. No evidence is found in these commuting data to support the spatial mismatch hypothesis. -Authors},

We find that these principles interact with platform design decisions to create systemic biases in which the sharing economy is significantly more effective in dense, high socioeconomic status (SES) areas than in low-SES areas and the suburbs. We further show that these results are robust across two sharing economy platforms: UberX and TaskRabbit. In addition to highlighting systemic sharing economy biases, this article more fundamentally demonstrates the importance of considering well-known geographic principles when designing and studying sharing economy platforms.},

Any city planning to launch a program will be keenly interested in understanding who may use it to enable strategic marketing that will facilitate quick uptake and adoption. The diffusion of innovation theory was applied to data from a population-based telephone survey to characterize who would be most likely to use a new public bikeshare program. A telephone survey of 901 residents of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, was conducted before the launch of Vancouver's public bikeshare program. Results showed that a majority [n = 614/901, 69.1\%; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 66.3\%, 72.7\%] of respondents thought that a public bikeshare program was a good idea; however, only one-quarter (n = 217/901, 24.2\%; 95\% CI = 21.1\%, 27.3\%) said that they would be likely or very likely to use the program. Logistic regression identified characteristics associated with higher and lower likelihood of use, which were used to create an adoption curve that defines population segments anticipated to be the leaders in adopting the program. The theory was used to develop implementation recommendations to maximize program uptake, including ensuring that the program would have tangible advantages over driving and transit, would be affordable and easy to try, would integrate with transit and carshare opportunities, and would appeal to social trends such as environmental responsibility. These results can assist planning and promotion in cities set to launch public bikeshare programs.},

We review scientific evidence from promising interventions focused on the social determinants of health and discuss how such interventions can improve population health and reduce health disparities. We found sufficient evidence of successful outcomes to support disparity-reducing policy interventions targeted at education and early childhood; urban planning and community development; housing; income enhancements and supplements; and employment. Cost-effectiveness evaluations show that these interventions lead to long-term societal savings, but the interventions require more routine attention to cost considerations. We discuss challenges to implementation, including the need for long-term financing to scale up effective interventions for implementation at the local, state, and national levels.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great challenge for contemporary public transportation worldwide, resulting from an unprecedented decline in demand and revenue. In this paper, we synthesize the state-of-the-art, up to early June 2020, on key developments regarding public transportation and the COVID-19 pandemic, including the different responses adopted by governments and public transportation agencies around the world, and the research needs pertaining to critical issues that minimize contagion risk in public transportation in the so-called post-lockdown phase. While attempts at adherence to physical distancing (which challenges the very concept of mass public transportation) are looming in several countries, the latest research shows that for closed environments such as public transportation vehicles, the proper use of face masks has significantly reduced the probability of contagion. The economic and social effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in public transportation extend beyond service performance and health risks to financial viability, social equity, and sustainable mobility. There is a risk that if the public transportation sector is perceived as poorly transitioning to post-pandemic conditions, that viewing public transportation as unhealthy will gain ground and might be sustained. To this end, this paper identifies the research needs and outlines a research agenda for the public health implications of alternative strategies and scenarios, specifically measures to reduce crowding in public transportation. The paper provides an overview and an outlook for transit policy makers, planners, and researchers to map the state-of-affairs and research needs related to the impacts of the pandemic crisis on public transportation. Some research needs require urgent attention given what is ultimately at stake in several countries: restoring the ability of public transportation systems to fulfill their societal role.},

Car commuting needs to be drastically reduced, yet universities effectively subsidize continued car usage through free- or below-cost car park provision. Strategies for reducing environmental damage caused by commuting are outlined and the development of bicycle-friendly policies is used as a case study. The importance of simultaneous promotion of `green' modes and the restraint of `red' modes is emphasized, as is the growing political acceptability of such approaches. The arguments are relevant to other campus environments such as hospitals, science parks and, in a non-spatial sense, to companies and institutions in general.},

For pollution variables which show such a relationship, we hypothesize that a more equitable distribution of power contributes to these outcomes, by enhancing the influence on policy of those who bear the costs of pollution, relative to the influence of those who benefit from pollution-generating activities. An empirical analysis of international variations in seven indicators of air and water quality supports this hypothesis. Literacy, political rights, and civil liberties are found to have particularly strong effects on environmental quality in low-income countries.

  abstract = {The transport of hazardous materials represents a significant percentage of the total transportation costs of goods. Hazardous materials (HazMats) comprise explosives, flammables, oxidizing substances, poisonous gases, and radioactive materials. These materials can be extremely harmful to the environment and human health, since exposure to their toxic ingredients can injure or kill plants, animals, and humans. The hazards associated with HazMat transportation cannot be avoided because commodities will always need to be transported to areas of need. The risk associated with transporting a HazMat depends not only on the substance being transported, but also on the characteristics of the road network such as road type, weather conditions, drivers' skills, and population concentration along the chosen routes. The risk associated with such an activity is essentially related to the possibility of an accident with negative environmental and public health consequences. Reducing the potential negative impacts of transporting HazMat is an important task for communities, governments, HazMat producers and shippers. Over the last few decades, systems have been developed to help decision-makers find the best solutions. Typically, the software used is a decision support system. This paper is a review on the experiences of using such systems over the last few years.},

A century ago, the telegraph and the mechanical tabulator were used to tame cities of millions. Today, cellular networks and cloud computing tie together the complex choreography of mega-regions of tens of millions of people.In response, cities worldwide are deploying technology to address both the timeless challenges of government and the mounting problems posed by human settlements of previously unimaginable size and complexity. In Chicago, GPS sensors on snow plows feed a real-time "plow tracker" map that everyone can access. In Zaragoza, Spain, a "citizen card" can get you on the free city-wide Wi-Fi network, unlock a bike share, check a book out of the library, and pay for your bus ride home. In New York, a guerrilla group of citizen-scientists installed sensors in local sewers to alert you when stormwater runoff overwhelms the system, dumping waste into local waterways.As technology barons, entrepreneurs, mayors, and an emerging vanguard of civic hackers are trying to shape this new frontier, Smart Cities considers the motivations, aspirations, and shortcomings of them all while offering a new civics to guide our efforts as we build the future together, one click at a time.},

Robust linear regression models were used in order to predict the flows of each station. The data used in this project consists of over 6 million bike sharing trips recorded in 2011. The built environment variables used in the model are determined in a buffer zone of 300 meters around each bike sharing station. In order to estimate the bike sharing flow, we use the method of linear regression during the peak periods of a weekday. The results show that bike sharing is principally used for commuting purposes by long term subscribers while short term subscriber's trips purposes are more varied. The combination between bike sharing and train seems to be an important inter-modality. An interesting finding is that student is an important user of bike sharing. We found that there were different types of bikesharing usage which are influenced by socio-economic factors depending on the period within the day and type of subscribers. The present findings could be useful for others cities which want to adopt a bikesharing system and also for a better planning and operation of existing systems. Further, the solutions to encourage the use of bikesharing will be various depending on type of subscribers. The approach in this paper can be useful for estimating car-sharing demand.},

This paper presents some ways in which women farmers practice civic agriculture. The data come from in-depth interviews with women practicing agriculture in Pennsylvania. Some of the strategies women farmers use to make a living from the farm have little to do with food or agricultural products, but all are a product of the process of providing a living for farmers while meeting a social need in the community. Most of the women in our study also connect their business practices to their gender identity in rural and agricultural communities, and redefine successful farming in opposition to traditional views of economic rationality.},

Two hundred twenty-eight (91.6\%) were injured as riders and 21 (8.4\%) as nonriders. Twenty-seven patients were younger than 18 years (10.8\%). Ten riders (4.4\%) were documented as having worn a helmet, and 12 patients (4.8\%) had either a blood alcohol level greater than 0.05\% or were perceived to be intoxicated by a physician. Frequent injuries included fractures (79 [31.7\%]), head injury (100 [40.2\%]), and contusions, sprains, and lacerations without fracture or head injury (69 [27.7\%]). The majority of patients (234 [94.0\%]) were discharged home from the emergency department; of the 15 admitted patients, 2 had severe injuries and were admitted to the intensive care unit.

Drivers who are looking for a parking space in peak hours are often forced to drive around city blocks until they spot a free parking space. This process is termed in literature ``cruising for parking'' and is proven to (a) cost a lot of time and gas for drivers, (b) generate unnecessary traffic load, and (c) affect the environment negatively due to increased vehicle emissions. This work proposes a Parking Monitoring and Management System (PMMS) that collects, processes, and presents data about available parking spaces and their tariffs within a geographical region. The end-user application of the PMMS, parkITsmart, delivers at drivers bird's-eye view concerning the parking availability. To facilitate this, the PMMS gathers data from drivers', vehicles, their mobile phones, and Parking Inspectors (PIs). This work shows that in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment, ``pairing'' cars and drivers' mobile phones, collecting data from their sensors, and from PIs in a parking monitoring and management system, can decrease significantly cruising times for parking and can increase the time demands of the parking controlling process.},

The reality is that hi-tech, modern electric bicycles have come of age in Western Europe and America, where quality manufacturers and some of the world's best engineers are introducing amazing new technologies and design. The results are innovative and highly efficient electric bicycles that provide safe alternative transportation in such a fun, healthy and environmentally responsible manner as to make urban automobile use obsolete.	Jim Turner is an expert in the field of electric bikes. He designed and builds the Optibike, considered one of today's premiere electric bikes.  Indeed, the New York Times called the Optibike the ``Ferrari of Electric Bikes''.  The book has information on all aspects of electric bikes, including the styles of motors, quality of batteries, mileage range and energy efficiency, and how easy it is to get your exercise while enjoying a fun ride.  What is an electric bike? Come on along for the ride and find out!},

  abstract = {Community gardens have been identified as providing a model for promoting sustainable urban living. They can also contribute to individual and community reconnection to the socio-cultural importance of food, thus helping facilitate broader engagement with the food system. Such processes may offer pathways to developing a deep engagement and long-term commitment to sustainable living practices predicated on the development of new forms of environmental or ecological citizenship. However, little attention has been paid to how this can be adequately harnessed. Based on an ethnographic study of community gardeners in the Australian Capital Territory, this article argues that fostering an embodied form of sustainability, which accounts for individual embodied engagement in these collective spaces, may play a critical role in achieving these outcomes.},

Research evaluating the degree to which this gender differential in commuting may be explained by the division of labor in the household has produced decidedly mixed findings. This paper presents a critical review of the methods and results of recent research on the gender differential in commuting along with the associated implications for the household responsibility hypothesis (HRH). While all of the articles reviewed are informative and unique, not all conclusions are well supported. The paper then tests the HRH using the 1990 NPTS travel data. The new evidence confirms that women continue to exhibit shorter commute times and distances than men and provides support for the HRH. The paper concludes with a summary of findings and recommendations for further research.},

However, the data requirements are higher than for the screening and the ISCST3 models, in particular meteorological, topography and land use data for the modelling domain. This work presents a methodology for implementation of the AERMOD modelling system when local data is incomplete and is not in the format required by the model, which is a typical situation in many countries, particularly in developing ones. In addition, the main computational tools developed to achieve this objective were presented: LandUse.xls, which takes the place of AERSURFACE; AERMET+, a version of AERMET that runs without upper air sounding meteorological data; and SD\_Aermet, which converts the surface meteorological data to a format accepted by AERMET. Three representative case studies were also presented, and the modelling results of a case study were compared to measurement data. The work concludes with a discussion of the possibility of using the AERMOD model in Cuba and in other countries, even when some input data is absent and climatological conditions differ from the medium latitudes for which the model was developed for.},

It is aimed at researchers with their own data ready to be analyzed and at students who would like an approachable alternative view of the subject. Each new topic in categorical data analysis is illustrated with an example that readers can apply to their own sets of data. In many cases, R code is given and excerpts from the resulting output are presented. In the context of log-linear models for cross-tabulations, two specialties of the house have been included: the use of cobweb diagrams to get visual information concerning significant interactions, and a procedure for detecting outlier category combinations. The R code used for these is available and may be freely adapted. In addition, this book: Uses an example to illustrate each new topic in categorical data Provides a clear explanation of an important subject Is understandable to most readers with minimal statistical and mathematical backgrounds Contains examples that are accompanied by R code and resulting output Includes starred sections that provide more background details for interested readers Categorical Data Analysis by Example is a reference for students in statistics and researchers in other disciplines, especially the social sciences, who use categorical data.

  abstract = {The U.S. Census Bureau designed the American Community Survey (ACS) to provide annual estimates of social and economic characteristics for states, counties, municipalities, census tracts, and block groups. Because of its April 1 reference date, in northern nonmetropolitan counties with substantial seasonal population fluctuations the decennial census provides a statistical representation of the demographic and social characteristics of the population at a time when the population is close to its annual minimum. The year-round monthly ACS sample survey has the potential to provide local communities with an unprecedented understanding of the average population characteristics over the course of a year. In the future, the ACS even has the potential for providing social and economic characteristics of the population by season. This paper examines four ACS pilot data collection counties, Oneida and Vilas Counties in northern Wisconsin, and Lake and Flathead Counties in northwest Montana. We hypothesize that the ACS will reflect a resident population over the course of the year that is different from the traditional April 1 decennial census population. While the ACS holds much promise, our research uncovered some sampling problems that are not yet fully resolved. In addition, our analysis was not able to examine ACS estimates for minor civil divisions (MCDs), which are functioning governmental units in many states. The fact that these MCDs often have very small populations, together with the fact that estimated standard errors at the much larger census tract level in these counties are disconcertingly large, raises (currently unanswerable) questions concerning the eventual statistical quality of ACS estimates for small MCDs. Consequently, the adequacy of the ACS as a replacement for the census long form may depend on the ability of the Census Bureau to effectively address the concerns presented in this analysis.},

Or that you can gauge a nation's driving behavior by its levels of corruption? These are only a few of the remarkable dynamics that Tom Vanderbilt explores in this fascinating tour through the mysteries of the road. Based on exhaustive research and interviews with driving experts and traffic officials around the globe, Traffic gets under the hood of the everyday activity of driving to uncover the surprisingly complex web of physical, psychological, and technical factors that explain how traffic works, why we drive the way we do, and what our driving says about us. Vanderbilt examines the perceptual limits and cognitive underpinnings that make us worse drivers than we think we are. He demonstrates why plans to protect pedestrians from cars often lead to more accidents. He shows how roundabouts, which can feel dangerous and chaotic, actually make roads safer\textemdash and reduce traffic in the bargain. He uncovers who is more likely to honk at whom, and why. He explains why traffic jams form, outlines the unintended consequences of our quest for safety, and even identifies the most common mistake drivers make in parking lots.The car has long been a central part of American life; whether we see it as a symbol of freedom or a symptom of sprawl, we define ourselves by what and how we drive. As Vanderbilt shows, driving is a provocatively revealing prism for examining how our minds work and the ways in which we interact with one another. Ultimately, Traffic is about more than driving: it's about human nature. This book will change the way we see ourselves and the world around us. And who knows? It may even make us better drivers.},

We found that local knowledge was conditioned by a complexity of factors, including the dynamic of actions that develop around the tool and the way of looking imposed by map-based representation.

Besides governments, employers are key players in this strive for a more sustainable commute. However, commuting research tends to focus on individual commuters and their place of residence, rather than on workplaces and company-induced measures. Therefore, this paper takes the workplace as research unit to analyse the popularity of carpooling in Belgium. After an exploratory (spatial) data analysis, we incorporate three groups of factors in a multilevel regression model which predicts the share of carpooling at large workplaces: location (accessibility), organisation (activity sector), and promotion (carpool-oriented mobility management measures). Higher levels of carpooling are found at less accessible locations, and in the activity sectors construction, manufacturing and transport. This analysis gives insight in the determinants of carpooling, and may thus contribute to the development of sustainable transport policies.},

  abstract = {High pollution levels have been often observed in urban street canyons due to the increased traffic emissions and reduced natural ventilation. Microscale dispersion models with different levels of complexity may be used to assess urban air quality and support decision-making for pollution control strategies and traffic planning. Mathematical models calculate pollutant concentrations by solving either analytically a simplified set of parametric equations or numerically a set of differential equations that describe in detail wind flow and pollutant dispersion. Street canyon models, which might also include simplified photochemistry and particle deposition\textendash resuspension algorithms, are often nested within larger-scale urban dispersion codes. Reduced-scale physical models in wind tunnels may also be used for investigating atmospheric processes within urban canyons and validating mathematical models. A range of monitoring techniques is used to measure pollutant concentrations in urban streets. Point measurement methods (continuous monitoring, passive and active pre-concentration sampling, grab sampling) are available for gaseous pollutants. A number of sampling techniques (mainly based on filtration and impaction) can be used to obtain mass concentration, size distribution and chemical composition of particles. A combination of different sampling/monitoring techniques is often adopted in experimental studies. Relatively simple mathematical models have usually been used in association with field measurements to obtain and interpret time series of pollutant concentrations at a limited number of receptor locations in street canyons. On the other hand, advanced numerical codes have often been applied in combination with wind tunnel and/or field data to simulate small-scale dispersion within the urban canopy.},

Nonetheless, it is difficult to guarantee significant individual opportunities by fighting mobility-related social exclusion, especially in Global South cities characterized by scarce provision of mobility services and wide presence of urban poverty.Case studyThe city of Bogot\'a has addressed the issues of mobility-related social exclusion by creating a large bus rapid transit system, called TransMilenio. Introduced in 2000, the public transport network was intended to provide a wider access to urban opportunities to a wider share of the urban population.Discussion and evaluationThe TransMilenio has been an influential example due to its ability in addressing the messed mobility of a typical Global South metropolis and in promoting an intervention that requires less financial resources in comparison to other, traditional infrastructures. However, its results appear as partial when discussing the contribution of TransMilenio to urban access, as well as the economic and political implications of implementing such system.ConclusionsWhile relevant is the alternative form of intervention promoted by TransMilenio, as well as its courage in addressing the apparently untamable mobility of a metropolis like Bogot\'a, similar strategies in the future should pay more attention to the issues of access\textemdash intended both as the possibility to make use of this public transport system, both in terms of reaching urban opportunities.},

The US Department of Transportation recently launched a campaign, "Everyone is a Pedestrian," inviting cities with disproportionately high pedestrian fatalities to apply to become one of six focus cities in a coordinated effort to drastically decrease pedestrian fatalities around the country. While motorist deaths have steadily decreased as automakers continually incorporate new safety features, road designers and traffic engineers have been constrained by standards and guidelines that are outdated and often inappropriate when applied in current urban contexts.

Findings from Africa, Asia, and Latin America all suggest that BRT does offer significant benefits to low-income groups, in terms of travel time and cost savings, access enhancement, and safety and health benefits. However benefits are often skewed toward medium-income users and thus less progressive than they might be. Two primary reasons for this are insufficient spatial coverage and inappropriate fare policies. While many features of BRT potentially allow it to deliver pro-poor outcomes, such outcomes only materialize if BRT implementers pay specific and sustained attention to equity. The paper identifies key issues that need to be addressed to steer BRT implementation toward more socially sustainable outcomes\textemdash including better integration with other transit, paratransit, and nonmotorized transport services, and with the housing sector.},

It was found that work trip lengths had in general not grown over the 6 year period. Growth of the work force had contributed more to the growth in local traffic congestion than had a lengthening of the work trip over time. The automobile remains the dominant mode of travel between home and work for these employees, and choices of residential location were found to be based upon many factors in addition to the home-work separation, such as quality of neighbourhood and schools and perceived safety.},

This article presents a framework for analyzing the relationship between short-term rentals and gentrification, an exploratory case study of New York City, and an agenda for future research. We argue that Airbnb has introduced a new potential revenue flow into housing markets which is systematic but geographically uneven, creating a new form of rent gap in culturally desirable and internationally recognizable neighborhoods. This rent gap can emerge quickly\textemdash in advance of any declining property income\textemdash and requires minimal new capital to be exploited by a range of different housing actors, from developers to landlords, tenants, and homeowners. Performing spatial analysis on three years of Airbnb activity in New York City, we measure new capital flows into the short-term rental market, identify neighborhoods whose housing markets have already been significantly impacted by short term, identify neighborhoods which are increasingly under threat of Airbnb-induced gentrification, and estimate the amount of rental housing lost to Airbnb. Finally, we conclude by offering a research agenda on gentrification and the sharing economy.},

These institutions have turned into instruemnts of surveillance, suspicion, and exclusion rather than vehicles of social integration and trust-building. Together with the withdrawal of the wage-labor economy in the context of extreme racial segregation, their debilitation has accelerated the shrinking of the ghetto's indigenous organizational basis and helped concentrate in it the most dispossessed segments of the urban (sub)proletariat. This suggests that state structures and policies play a decisive role in the formation and distribution of both formal and informal social capital.},

  abstract = {Centuries-old community planning practices in Indigenous communities in Canada, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia have, in modern times, been eclipsed by ill-suited western approaches, mostly derived from colonial and neo-colonial traditions. Since planning outcomes have failed to reflect the rights and interests of Indigenous people, attempts to reclaim planning have become a priority for many Indigenous nations throughout the world. In Reclaiming Indigenous Planning, scholars and practitioners connect the past and present to facilitate better planning for the future. With examples from the Canadian Arctic to the Australian desert, and the cities, towns, reserves and reservations in between, contributors engage topics including Indigenous mobilization and resistance, awareness-raising and seven-generations visioning, Indigenous participation in community planning processes, and forms of governance. Relying on case studies and personal narratives, these essays emphasize the critical need for Indigenous communities to reclaim control of the political, socio-cultural, and economic agendas that shape their lives. The first book to bring Indigenous and non-Indigenous authors together across continents, Reclaiming Indigenous Planning shows how urban and rural communities around the world are reformulating planning practices that incorporate traditional knowledge, cultural identity, and stewardship over land and resources.

Public policies and economic practices which increase marginalisation act to damage the ``weak ties'' of the community social networks which bind central city neighbourhoods into functioning units. Spreading disease and disorder can be interpreted as indices of the resulting social disintegration, which is driven by policy. This ``failure of containment'' in the United States should serve as a warning for cities in Europe against reducing the municipal and other services that they provide to ``unpopular'' subpopulations.},

The issue is important in environmental regulation, siting of hazardous waste repositories and prioritizing remediation of existing sources of exposure. We propose a statistical framework for assessing environmental justice. The framework includes a quantitative assessment of environmental equity based on the cumulative distribution of exposure within population subgroups linked to disease incidence through a dose-response function. This approach avoids arbitrary binary classifications of individuals solely as 'exposed' or 'unexposed'. We present a Bayesian inferential approach, implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, that accounts for uncertainty in both exposure and response. We illustrate our method using data on leukaemia deaths and exposure to toxic chemical releases in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.},

Alternatively, it is suggested that communicators develop individuating impressions of others through accumulated CMC messages. Based upon these impressions, users may develop relationships and express multidimensional relational messages through verbal or textual cues. Predictions regarding these processes are suggested, and future research incorporating these points is urged.},

The suitability of MI for registration of aerial LiDAR and aerial oblique images has been demonstrated in [17], under an assumption that minimization of joint entropy (JE) is a sufficient approximation of maximization of MI. In this paper, we show that this assumption is invalid for the ground-level data. The entropy of a LiDAR image can not be regarded as approximately constant for small perturbations. Instead of minimizing the JE, we directly maximize MI to estimate corrections of camera poses. Our method automatically registers mobile LiDAR with spherical panoramas over an approximate 4 kilometer drive, and is the first example we are aware of that tests mutual information registration in large-scale context.},

In order to understand the impacts of the reform and the influence of Danwei on jobs\textendash housing relationships and commuting behavior, this study investigates whether there are differences in commuting behavior between individuals who live in houses provided by Danwei and those who reside in houses from private market sources in urban China. We apply the structural equations model to investigate the interactions between housing source (from Danwei or not), jobs\textendash housing relationship, transport mode and commuting time in Beijing, the capital city of China. The results show that Danwei housing commuters have shorter commuting trips and higher usage of non-motorized transport mode than those who live in houses from the market sources. This finding implies that the diminishing influence of the traditional Danwei system and the market-oriented reform in urban development may have changed the jobs\textendash housing balance and increased travel demand in Chinese cities.},

  abstract = {It is well recognized that dilution is an important mechanism governing the near-road air pollutant concentrations. In this paper, we aim to advance our understanding of turbulent mixing mechanisms on and near roadways using computation fluid dynamics. Turbulent mixing mechanisms can be classified into three categories according to their origins: vehicle-induced turbulence (VIT), road-induced turbulence (RIT), and atmospheric boundary layer turbulence. RIT includes the turbulence generated by road embankment, road surface thermal effects, and roadside structures. Both VIT and RIT are affected by the roadway designs. We incorporate the detailed treatment of VIT and RIT into the CFD (namely CFD-VIT-RIT) and apply the model in simulating the spatial gradients of carbon monoxide near two major highways with different traffic mix and roadway configurations. The modeling results are compared to the field measurements and those from CALINE4 and CFD without considering VIT and RIT. We demonstrate that the incorporation of VIT and RIT considerably improves the modeling predictions, especially on vertical gradients and seasonal variations of carbon monoxide. Our study implies that roadway design can significantly influence the near-road air pollution. Thus we recommend that mitigating near-road air pollution through roadway designs be considered in the air quality and transportation management In addition, thanks to the rigorous representation of turbulent mixing mechanisms, CFD-VIT-RIT can become valuable tools in the roadway designs process.},

The method consists of a series of procedures including data cleaning and pre-processing, inferring and removing pseudo trip ends, as well as trip combination. The result of the model has been compared with the ``ground truth'' collected and verified by volunteers. Finally, 1954 trips from 125 volunteers were identified and the overall detection accuracy is between 97.5\% and 98.7\% with a 95\% confidence level. Besides, purity was introduced to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. In addition, the integration of instantaneous speed over time shows an excellent performance in calculating the trip distance.},

The article takes a first step in this direction by proposing a `clash of rationalities', between techno-managerial and marketised systems of government administration, service provision and planning (in those parts of the world where these apply) and increasingly marginalised urban populations surviving largely under conditions of informality. It draws together theoretical resources beyond the boundaries of conventional planning theory to understand the nature of this conflict, and the nature of the `interface' between those involved, where unpredictable encounter and contestation also open the possibility for exploring alternative approaches to planning.},

  abstract = {Active mobility (AM), including walking and cycling as single trips or in combination with public transport, has recently been promoted by health professionals \textendash{} with WHO leading the way \textendash{} to tackle health problems caused by physical inactivity. In fact only 1/3 of the European population is estimated to meet the minimum recommended levels of physical activity by the WHO of 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity 5 times per week. Being aware that we spend between 70 to 80 min per day travelling and that 50\% of all car trips (in Europe) are shorter than 5 km, active mobility has an enormous potential to get people more active. However, how is this knowledge of proven positive health effects of AM been taken into account \textendash{} either by urban and transport planning authorities or by health administration? Is this ,,new health trend`` visible in strategies, cooperation or \textendash{} what's even more important \textendash{} in implemented measures in smart cities? ``Physical activity through sustainable transport approaches'' (PASTA1 )'' is a European project addressing and analyzing the promising link between transport and health. It pursues an interdisciplinary approach involving scientists and leading experts from a range of disciplines, including (among others) transport and urban planning, public health, environmental sciences, climate change and energy, and transport economics. The overall aim of the project is to generate knowledge about the effects of AM in consideration of health effects. This paper reveals backgrounds and relationships between transport and health work in seven European case study cities (Antwerp, Barcelona, London, \"Orebro, Rome, Vienna and Zurich) based on workshops and stakeholder interviews conducted in PASTA. Considering cities` framework conditions (strategies and policies, infrastructure and other measures promoting AM etc.) and comparing stakeholders` perspectives bring out that cities have to struggle with similar barriers and challenges. Otherwise they take promising approaches and efforts towards sustainable and healthy urban development; increasing synergies between the health and transport sector seems to be one of the missing links between transport and health. Good practices and new ideas for transport planners and health experts are provided aiding to create livable conditions through well-planned infrastructure, a safe environment and attractive public space, awareness-raising activities and various broader policies \textendash{} including the health policy. After all AM should not just be an ephemeral health trend, but common (health) practice.},

  abstract = {Ghost dwellings are defined as housing units that are vacant but not abandoned nor available for rent or sale; their owners only occasionally reside in them. In big cities, they are thought to contribute to various ills such as housing unaffordability and a deadening of urban life and culture. This study provides the first systematic assessment of the spatial extent of ghost dwellings in the 50 largest cities in the United States. It quantifies their concentration at the city, neighborhood, and building scales. In keeping with the tenor of recent media reports, ghost dwellings are increasing rapidly in most big cities, albeit from a small base. They concentrate in a small number of highly privileged and well-known neighborhoods. The epicenters are a surprisingly varied collection of cities, ranging from globally renowned Miami and Las Vegas to the less well-known Austin and Atlanta. A loose test of several possible hypotheses driving ghost dwelling growth on the basis of locational patterns finds the strongest support for exclusion and retirement orientation as mechanisms. In certain cities, ghost dwellings are strongly associated with particular building formats such as high-rises and condominiums.},

It uses the findings to put forth four general principles for cities seeking to manage impacts imposed by Airbnb and its competitors. These are that webscraping is an imperfect but relatively cheap and effective means of gathering locally specific data; that ``spiky'' usage patterns dictate a microgeographic approach to regulation; that meaningful regulation necessitates dedicated enforcement, likely paid for with permit fees; and that it is desirable to distinguish between ``mom-and-pop'' hosts and those operating at a commercial scale.},

Mitigation and suppression of new infections have emerged as the two predominant public health control strategies5. Both strategies focus on reducing new infections by limiting human-to-human interactions, which could be both socially and economically unsustainable in the long term. We have developed and analyzed an epidemiological intervention model that leverages serological tests6,7 to identify and deploy recovered individuals8 as focal points for sustaining safer interactions via interaction substitution, developing what we term `shield immunity' at the population scale. The objective of a shield immunity strategy is to help to sustain the interactions necessary for the functioning of essential goods and services9 while reducing the probability of transmission. Our shield immunity approach could substantively reduce the length and reduce the overall burden of the current outbreak, and can work synergistically with social distancing. The present model highlights the value of serological testing as part of intervention strategies, in addition to its well-recognized roles in estimating prevalence10,11 and in the potential development of plasma-based therapies12\textendash 15.},

This is true, Christopher Wells argues, because the United States is Car Country - a nation dominated by landscapes that are difficult, inconvenient, and often even unsafe to navigate by those who are not sitting behind the wheel of a car. The prevalence of car-dependent landscapes seems perfectly natural to us today, but it is, in fact, a relatively new historical development. In Car Country, Wells rejects the idea that the nation's automotive status quo can be explained as a simple byproduct of an ardent love affair with the automobile. Instead, he takes readers on a lively tour of the evolving American landscape, charting the ways that new transportation policies and land-use practices have combined to reshape nearly every element of the built environment around the easy movement of automobiles.From the dawn of the motor age to the establishment of the Interstate Highway System and the rise of the suburbs, Wells untangles the complicated relationships between automobiles and the environment, allowing readers to see the everyday world in a completely new way. The result is a history that is essential for understanding American transportation and land-use issues today.},

Based on a multiwave survey of Metrorail users in the months after the crash, this article reports how the accident appears to have (1) changed over time the tradeoffs among safety, speed, frequency of service, cost, and reliability that the transit users stated they were willing to make in the postaccident period and (2) altered transit users' concerns about safety as a function of time and distance from the accident site. We employ conditional logit models to examine tradeoffs among stated preferences for system performance measures after the accident, as well as the influence that respondent characteristics of transit use, location, income, age, and gender have on these preference tradeoffs. As expected, respondents appear averse to longer headways between trains, longer travel durations, higher travel costs, a higher number of late trains, and a higher number of fatalities. The models also show evidence of higher aversion to fatalities from transit system operation among females compared to males. In addition, respondents less experienced with Metrorail travel and those with lower household incomes show higher aversion to fatalities, and this aversion increases as a subject's psychological distance from the accident site decreases. Contrary to expectations shaped by previous studies, aversion to fatalities appears to have increased between the early months after the accident and the end of the survey period, and the expected relationship between age and aversion to fatalities is not statistically significant.},

It has been noted that students tend to use a variety of transportation modes, including active travel, more frequently than other population segments. Investigating the modal choice of university students provides a unique opportunity to understand a population that has a large proportion of active commuters at a major trip-generating location. In turn, this can provide valuable insights into the factors that influence active travel. In this paper, we report the results of a mode choice analysis among university students, using as a case study McMaster University, in Hamilton, Canada. The results from this research indicate that modal choices are influenced by a combination of cost, individual attitudes, and environmental factors such as street and sidewalk density. A key finding is that travel time by car and bicycle positively affect the utilities of these modes, although at a decreasing rate as travel time increases. While the positive utility of time spent traveling by car has been documented in other settings, our analysis provides evidence of the intrinsic value that cyclists place on their trip experience. Examples of transportation policy measures suggested by the analysis are discussed.},

The report exposes the extent to which the urban poor suffer disproportionately from a wide range of diseases and health problems, which can be traced back to inequalities in their social and living conditions. It also provides evidence-based information and tools to help municipal and health authorities tackle health inequities in their cities.  The case for action is juxtaposed with personal stories and photos illustrating the issues of urban health equity in six countries. Stories of municipal and national authorities who are taking action to reduce inequities also are featured.},

This is a sharp increase from 2011, when 375 schemes operated 236,000 bikes.

  abstract = {Globally, the carsharing domain is growing, and new service offerings are arising. Peer-to-peer carsharing, facilitating car rental between private individuals, has attracted attention from entrepreneurs and researchers alike. Irrespective of this trend studies on carsharing have been predominantly focusing on identifying users' consumption motives in business-to-consumer contexts. Consequently, insights on consumers' motivational drivers to offer peer-to-peer carsharing services remain scarce. By conducting a series of laddering interviews with German peer-providers, we add to extant literature by uncovering four overarching motivational patterns that drive consumers' decision to participate as providers in peer-to-peer carsharing: economic interest (``earn''), quality of life (``enjoy''), helping others (``enrich''), and sustainability (``enhance''). Although self-centered motives of economic interest and quality of life are the dominating participation motives, peer-providers also seem to be intrigued by the possibility of helping others in terms of providing mobility and thereby enabling the creation of lasting memories. Paradoxically to previous assumptions regarding participation in sharing activities, sustainability is not a main participation motive for most peer-providers but is rather seen as an indirect consequence of participation.},

With global chemical production projected to double over the next 24 years, federal policies that shape the priorities of the U.S. chemical enterprise will be a cornerstone of sustainability. To date, these policies have largely failed to adequately protect public health or the environment or motivate investment in or scientific exploration of cleaner chemical technologies, known collectively as green chemistry. On this trajectory, the United States will face growing health, environmental, and economic problems related to chemical exposures and pollution. Conclusions Existing policies have produced a U.S. chemicals market in which the safety of chemicals for human health and the environment is undervalued relative to chemical function, price, and performance. This market barrier to green chemistry is primarily a consequence of weaknesses in the Toxic Substances Control Act. These weaknesses have produced a chemical data gap, because producers are not required to investigate and disclose sufficient information on chemicals' hazard traits to government, businesses that use chemicals, or the public; a safety gap, because government lacks the legal tools it needs to efficiently identify, prioritize, and take action to mitigate the potential health and environmental effects of hazardous chemicals; and a technology gap, because industry and government have invested only marginally in green chemistry research, development, and education. Policy reforms that close the three gaps\textemdash creating transparency and accountability in the market\textemdash are crucial for improving public and environmental health and reducing the barriers to green chemistry. The European Union's REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) regulation has opened an opportunity for the United States to take this step; doing so will present the nation with new research questions in science, policy, law, and technology.},

  abstract = {Objectives Promoting active commuting is viewed as one strategy to increase physical activity and improve the energy balance of more sedentary individuals thereby improving health outcomes. However, the potential effectiveness of promotion policies may be seriously undermined by the endogenous choice of commute mode. Policy to promote active commuting will be most effective if it can be demonstrated that 1) those in compact cities do not necessarily have a preference for more physical activity, and 2) that current active commuting is not explained by unobserved characteristics that may be the true source of a lower body mass index (BMI). Methods Daily time-use diaries are used in combination with geographical characteristics of where respondents live and work to test 1) whether residents of more compact settlements are characterized by higher activity levels; and 2) whether residents of more compact settlements are more likely to bike or walk to work. An endogenous treatment model of active commuting allows testing whether reductions in BMI associated with walking or biking to work are in fact attributable to that activity or are more strongly associated with unobserved characteristics of these active commuters. Results The analysis of general activity levels confirms that residents of more compact cities do not expend more energy than residents of more sprawling cities, indicating that those in compact cities do not necessarily have a preference for more physical activity. The endogenous treatment model is consistent with walking or biking to work having an independent effect on BMI, as unobserved factors that contribute to a higher likelihood of active commuting are not associated with lower BMI. Conclusions Despite evidence that more compact settlement patterns enable active commuting, only a small share of workers in these areas choose to walk or bike to work. In general, the activity level of residents in more compact cities and residents in more sprawling areas is very similar. But, there is a robust association between active commuting and lower body mass index that is not explained by unobserved attributes or preferences suggests that policies to promote active commuting may be effective. In particular, active commuting has a greater effect on BMI. Consequently, compact settlement appears to be an effective infrastructure for promoting more active lifestyles. The policy challenge is finding ways to ensure that this infrastructure is more widely utilized.},

  abstract = {Urban green space, such as parks, forests, green roofs, streams, and community gardens, provides critical ecosystem services. Green space also promotes physical activity, psychological well-being, and the general public health of urban residents. This paper reviews the Anglo-American literature on urban green space, especially parks, and compares efforts to green US and Chinese cities. Most studies reveal that the distribution of such space often disproportionately benefits predominantly White and more affluent communities. Access to green space is therefore increasingly recognized as an environmental justice issue. Many US cities have implemented strategies to increase the supply of urban green space, especially in park-poor neighborhoods. Strategies include greening of remnant urban land and reuse of obsolete or underutilized transportation infrastructure. Similar strategies are being employed in Chinese cities where there is more state control of land supply but similar market incentives for urban greening. In both contexts, however, urban green space strategies may be paradoxical: while the creation of new green space to address environmental justice problems can make neighborhoods healthier and more esthetically attractive, it also can increase housing costs and property values. Ultimately, this can lead to gentrification and a displacement of the very residents the green space strategies were designed to benefit. Urban planners, designers, and ecologists, therefore, need to focus on urban green space strategies that are `just green enough' and that explicitly protect social as well as ecological sustainability.},

We're proud to see a Seattle native son helping to show the way." \textendash{} Mike McGinn, Mayor of Seattle, founding Executive Director, Seattle Great City InitiativeThis beautifully illustrated short e-book explores the idea that to create vibrant, sustainable cities, we must first understand what happens naturally when people congregate in cities \textendash{} innate, unprompted interactions of urban dwellers with each other and their surrounding environment. Good places are rooted in acknowledgement of a city's history and the everyday uses of urban space. Wolfe argues that city dwellers invariably celebrate environments where and when they can coexist safely, in a mutually supportive way and believes such celebration is most interesting when it occurs spontaneously \textendash{} seemingly without effort. He contends it is critical to first isolate these spontaneous and latent examples of successful urban land use, before applying any prescriptive government policies or initiatives. Wolfe provides something rare in contemporary urbanist writing \textendash{} rich illustrations and examples from real life \textendash{} both historical and current. His writing about the past and the future of urban form offers readers inspiration, historical context, and a better understanding of how a sustainable, inviting urban environment is created.},

  abstract = {How should we understand the relationship between urban environments and infectious diseases? This article addresses this question from three particular perspectives: that of the materialities of health, that of nature and that of networks. The first perspective analytically blends biological dynamics, environmental influence and social practice. The second perspective, mainly influenced by multispecies ethnographies, foregrounds the liveliness and unboundedness of cities. Finally, the third perspective analyses how health is drawn into the domain of security. The article argues that while globalization and urbanization are often discussed as having triggered the emergence and spread of pathogens, urban epidemics are not self-evident and `natural' consequences of these pro-cesses. They do not fall neatly into universal categories of space, modernity or risk; rather, they are produced and shaped by a range of social, political, biological and economic sites and scales. Accordingly, the emergence of pathogens depends on its articulation through specific analytical frameworks. This article suggests that a critical focus on how infectious diseases manifest themselves differently in different local contexts may not only provide insights into the manifold forms of urban life, but also into the multiple, complex and highly political constitution of health.},

Twenty five participants (including 13 bicyclists who rode at least once per week, and 12 who rode once per month or less) cycled in place on a closed-road circuit at night-time and indicated when they were confident that an approaching driver would first recognize that a bicyclist was present. Participants wore black clothing alone or together with a fluorescent bicycling vest, a fluorescent bicycling vest with additional retroreflective tape, or the fluorescent retroreflective vest plus ankle and knee reflectors in a modified `biomotion' configuration. The bicycle had a light mounted on the handlebars which was either static, flashing or off. Participants judged that black clothing made them least visible, retroreflective strips on the legs in addition to a retroreflective vest made them most visible and that adding retroreflective materials to a fluorescent vest provides no conspicuity benefits. Flashing bicycle lights were associated with higher conspicuity than static lights. Additionally, occasional bicyclists judged themselves to be more visible than did frequent bicyclists. Overall, bicyclists overestimated their conspicuity compared to previously collected recognition distances and underestimated the conspicuity benefits of retroreflective markings on their ankles and knees. Participants mistakenly judged that a fluorescent vest that did not include retroreflective material would enhance their night-time conspicuity. These findings suggest that bicyclists have dangerous misconceptions concerning the magnitude of the night-time conspicuity problem and the potential value of conspicuity treatments.},

  abstract = {Background: People's time-location patterns are important in air pollution exposure assessment because pollution levels may vary considerably by location. A growing number of studies are using global positioning systems (GPS) to track people's time-location patterns. Many portable GPS units that archive location are commercially available at a cost that makes their use feasible for epidemiological studies. Methods: We evaluated the performance of five portable GPS data loggers and two GPS cell phones by examining positional accuracy in typical locations (indoor, outdoor, in-vehicle) and factors that influence satellite reception (building material, building type), acquisition time (cold and warm start), battery life, and adequacy of memory for data storage. We examined stationary locations (eg, indoor, outdoor) and mobile environments (eg, walking, traveling by vehicle or bus) and compared GPS locations to highly-resolved US Geological Survey (USGS) and Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quadrangle (DOQQ) maps. Results: The battery life of our tested instruments ranged from {$<$}9 hours to 48 hours. The acquisition of location time after startup ranged from a few seconds to {$>$}20 minutes and varied significantly by building structure type and by cold or warm start. No GPS device was found to have consistently superior performance with regard to spatial accuracy and signal loss. At fixed outdoor locations, 65\%\textendash 95\% of GPS points fell within 20-m of the corresponding DOQQ locations for all the devices. At fixed indoor locations, 50\%\textendash 80\% of GPS points fell within 20-m of the corresponding DOQQ locations for all the devices except one. Most of the GPS devices performed well during commuting on a freeway, with {$>$}80\% of points within 10-m of the DOQQ route, but the performance was significantly impacted by surrounding structures on surface streets in highly urbanized areas. Conclusions: All the tested GPS devices had limitations, but we identified several devices which showed promising performance for tracking subjects' time location patterns in epidemiological studies.},

  abstract = {Over the past couple of decades, global positioning system (GPS) technology has been utilized to collect large-scale data from travel surveys. As the precise spatiotemporal characteristics of travel could be provided by GPS devices, the issues of traditional travel survey, such as misreporting and non-response, could be addressed. Considering the defects of dedicated GPS devices (e.g., the need for a large sum of money to buy devices, forgetfulness in the taking of devices to collect data, limiting of the sample size because of the number of devices, etc.), and the fact that the smartphone is becoming one of the necessities of life, there is an opportunity for smartphones to replace dedicated GPS devices. Although several general reviews of GPS travel survey and GPS data-processing methods have been written, a systematic review of smartphone-based GPS data collection and travel mode detection has not be made.. The studies were collected from six databases. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the current literature on the existing methodologies of travel mode detection based on GPS raw data collected by smartphones. Meanwhile, according to a systematic comparison of the different methods of data preprocessing for travel mode detection, this paper details the strengths and weaknesses of the existing methods. Furthermore, it is a very important step towards developing methodologies and applications for GPS raw data collected by smartphones.},

It uses 1980 and 1990 PUMS data to analyze changes in racial and gender divisions in the workforce, and develops an estimate of work trip distance to adjust for different travel modes. It finds no independent link between segmentation and longer commutes among African Americans. Earnings and commute distances remained unchanged over the decade for African Americans, providing no evidence of a purely spatial mismatch manifest in lengthening work trips without corresponding wage gains. The spatial dimensions of an employment mismatch for inner-city minorities are concealed through the replacement of production jobs by poorly paid service work in the expanding downtown economy of a vibrant regional center.},

  abstract = {Over the past couple of decades, there has been an exponential increase in the collection of large-scale GPS data from household/personal travel surveys all over the world. A range of algorithms, which vary from specific rules to advanced machine learning methods, have been applied to extract travel modes from raw GPS data collected by smartphone-based travel surveys. However, most of the methods applied neither describe the interaction between features influencing the travel mode decision nor effectively deal with the ambiguity inherently incorporated in these features. This paper identifies travel modes with a Bayesian network, whose structure is established based on a K2 algorithm and corresponding conditional probability tables are estimated with maximum likelihood methods. Five representative travel modes \textendash{} walk, bike, e-bike, bus and car \textendash{} are distinguished using the resulting Bayesian network. Additionally, the low speed rate and the average heading change are introduced to reduce uncertainties between bike and e-bike segments and between bus and car segments. The derived travel modes are then compared with those retrieved in the prompted recall survey by telephones. Consequently, more than 86\% of segments have the travel mode correctly identified for each travel mode, with over 97\% of walk segments being properly flagged. Results from the study demonstrate that GPS travel surveys provide an opportunity to supplement traditional travel surveys.},

The growing volume of the dataset, however, creates processing and management difficulties, while the low quality generates uncertainties when investigating human activities. Based on the conception of the error distribution law and position accuracy of the GPS data, we propose in this paper a data cleaning method for this kind of spatial big data using movement consistency. First, a trajectory is partitioned into a set of sub-trajectories using the movement characteristic points. In this process, GPS points indicate that the motion status of the vehicle has transformed from one state into another, and are regarded as the movement characteristic points. Then, GPS data are cleaned based on the similarities of GPS points and the movement consistency model of the sub-trajectory. The movement consistency model is built using the random sample consensus algorithm based on the high spatial consistency of high-quality GPS data. The proposed method is evaluated based on extensive experiments, using GPS trajectories generated by a sample of vehicles over a 7-day period in Wuhan city, China. The results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.},

Though several socioeconomic factors (e.g., inequality) partially explain this phenomenon, the role of race/ethnic segregation, in general, and the different dimensions of segregation, more specifically, has been underexplored. Focusing on all-cause age-sex standardized US county-level mortality (2004\textendash 2008), this study has two substantive goals: (1) to understand whether segregation is a determinant of mortality and if yes, how the relationship between segregation and mortality varies by racial/ethnic dyads (e.g., white/black), and (2) to explore whether different dimensions of segregation (i.e., evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering) are associated with mortality. A third goal is methodological: to assess whether spatial autocorrelation influences our understanding of the associations between the dimensions of segregation and mortality. Race/ethnic segregation was found to contribute to the geographic mortality disparities. Moreover, the relationship with mortality differed by both race/ethnic group and the dimension of segregation. Specifically, white/black segregation is positively related to mortality, whereas the segregation between whites and non-black minorities is negatively associated with mortality. Among the five dimensions of segregation, evenness and exposure are more strongly related to mortality than other dimensions. Spatial filtering approaches also identified six unique spatial patterns that significantly affect the spatial distribution of mortality. These patterns offer possible insights that help identify omitted variables related to the persistent patterning of mortality in the US.},

Using Boston and Atlanta as two comparative regions, this research computes excess commuting with three-decade census data and then examines excess commuting in relation to the changes in metropolitan spatial structure. Empirical results suggest that the transport--land use connection appears weaker over the decades as the dispersion of jobs changes the dynamics of commuting and the selection of residential location follows patterns of average job location rather than that of the closest available job location. This decreasing transport--land use connection points to a spatial structure effect apart from individual preferences.

This study concerns two important issues with Internet GIS interoperability and Open source resources. Centering on the interplay of these two issues, we provide a systematic overview of techniques that have been used to deliver Internet GIS mapping and the relevance of the two issues with regard to these techniques. We then present a standard-and-open-source-based framework for Internet GIS mapping services to achieve data interoperability and high visual quality. The framework employs the Web Feature Service (WFS) to handle vector data and raster data. The Geography Markup Language (GML) standard is used for interoperable data storage and management. The Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) standard is used to visualize GML data in web browsers. Two preliminary prototypes have been developed to demonstrate the capabilities of the framework. We conclude that using standard-based solutions is an important and viable direction of interoperable Internet GIS services. Advances in standardization and technology have significant implications for Internet GIS mapping. There are many powerful open sources tools which, when coupled with open standards, may be used to develop high-quality online GIS services. Importantly, these solutions require no investment in software, yet achieve excellent interoperability and visualization quality; they are excellent alternative approaches to Internet mapping.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in communication technologies have enabled researchers to collect travel data based on ubiquitous and location-aware smartphones. These advances hold out the promise of allowing the automatic detection of the critical aspects (mode of transport, purpose, etc.) of people's trips. Until now, efforts have concentrated on one aspect of trips (e.g. mode) at a time. Such methods have typically been developed on small data sets, often with data collected by researchers themselves and not in large-scale real-world data collection initiatives. This research develops a machine learning-based framework to identify complete trip information based on smartphone location data as well as online data from GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) and Foursquare data. The framework has the potential to be integrated with smartphone travel surveys to produce all trip characteristics traditionally collected through household travel surveys. We use data from a recent, large-scale smartphone travel survey in Montr\'eal, Canada. The collected smartphone data, augmented with GTFS and Foursquare data are used to train and validate three random forest models to predict mode of transport, transit itinerary as well as trip purpose (activity). According to cross-validation analysis, the random forest models show prediction accuracies of 87\%, 81\% and 71\% for mode, transit itinerary and activity, respectively. The results compare favorably with previous studies, especially when taking the large, real-world nature of the dataset into account. Furthermore, the cross validation results show that the machine learning-based framework is an effective and automated tool to support trip information extraction for large-scale smartphone travel surveys, which have the potential to be a reliable and efficient (in terms of cost and human resources) data collection technique.},

Drawing on marketing ethics and sustainability literature, it argues that cultural and consumption values drive or deter the adoption of PBSS through the mediating mechanism of ethical evaluation. This study tests its hypotheses using a sample of 755 consumers from one of the largest PBSS programs in China. The results confirm the significance of collectivism, man\textendash nature orientation, materialism, and face-consciousness as key determinants of the adoption of PBSS. Interestingly, these values play mixed roles in influencing PBSS adoption. It also finds that such values and beliefs need to be effectively translated into ethical evaluations of PBSS adoption, and need to be addressed in the specific social context. Thus, ethical evaluation constitutes a cognitive strategy that allows consumers to justify and defend their adoption of sustainability practices. The results suggest that a desirable sustainability program needs to not only cater to the cultural and psychological motivations of consumers, but also reflect the social norms and social context in which the sustainability practices and consumers are embedded.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to measure ultrafine particle concentrations with diameters less than 1 mum emitted by diesel buses and to assess resulting human exposure levels. The study was conducted at the Woolloongabba Busway station in Brisbane, Australia in the winter months of 2002 during which temperature inversions frequently occurred. Most buses that utilize the station are fuelled by diesel, the exhaust of which contains a significant quantity of particle matter. Passengers waiting at the station are exposed to these particles emitted from the buses. During the course of this study, passenger census was conducted, based on video surveillance, yielding person-by-person waiting time data. Furthermore, a bus census revealed accurate information about the total number of diesel versus Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) powered buses. Background (outside of the bus station) and platform measurements of ultrafine particulate number size distributions were made to determine ambient aerosol concentrations. Particle number exposure concentration ranges from 10 and 40 to 60\% of bus related exhaust fumes. This changes dramatically when considering the particle mass exposure concentration, where most passengers are exposed to about 50 to 80\% of exhaust fumes. The obtained data can be very significant for comparison with similar work of this type because it is shown in previous studies that exhaust emissions causes cancer in laboratory animals. It was assumed that significant differences between platform and background distributions were due to bus emissions which, combined with passenger waiting times, yielded an estimate of passenger exposure to ultrafine particles from diesel buses. From an exposure point of view, the Busway station analyzed resembles a street canyon. Although the detected exhaust particle concentration at the outbound platform is found to be in the picogram range, exposure increases with the time passengers spend on the platform along with their breathing frequency.},

  abstract = {Car parking is an issue of significance both at the local and at the strategic level of planning. Parking policy and supply play a major role in the management of transportation systems in dense urban areas. Although the policies that govern the provision and operation of parking facilities are recognized to have an important bearing on the operation of urban transport systems, decisions have often been made on an ad hoc basis, without proper integration with other elements of transport systems analysis. In order for parking policy decisions to be well founded, the analysis of parking behaviour and the effects of parking policies should be fully integrated with the other elements of the transport planning and modelling process. To assist this interaction this paper presents a state-of-the-art review of models of parking as an integral component of urban transport systems. The paper develops model groupings by relating their main objectives: choice, allocation and interaction models. It then discusses the relationship between these structures pointing to a hierarchical suite of models for parking analysis. Models at each level in the hierarchy can be directed at particular policy questions. Taken together as a linked system they can provide a realistic and comprehensive representation of the entire parking system for an area. The hierarchical approach allows the advantages of each model type to be tailored to particular policy scenarios.},

To increase the accuracy of the model, spatial data (population, road network and point of interests such as petroleum stations and green spaces) and meteorological data (including temperature, pressure, wind speed and relative humidity) have also been used as independent variables, alongside air quality measurement data gathered by the monitoring stations. The outputs of the proposed model are evaluated against reference interpolation techniques including inverse distance weighting, thin plate splines, kriging, cokriging, and MARS3. Interpolation for 12~months showed better accuracies of the proposed model in comparison with the reference methods.},

First, the power consumption for analyzing sensor data must be low, since most wearables and portable devices are power-strapped. Second, the velocity of analyzing big data on these devices must be high, otherwise the limited local storage may overflow. This paper presents our hardware-software co-design of a classifier for wearables to detect a person's transportation mode (i.e., still, walking, running, biking, and on a vehicle). We particularly focus on addressing the big-data small-footprint requirement by designing a classifier that is low in both computational complexity and memory requirement. Together with a sensor-hub configuration, we are able to drastically reduce power consumption by 99\%, while maintaining competitive mode-detection accuracy.

This study integrates the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to develop a holistic model to explain the intention to use commercial bike-sharing systems. The PLS-SEM results from a survey with 286 users reveal that the intention to use commercial bike-sharing systems is positively affected by perceived usefulness of the system, attitude toward bike-sharing and perceived behavioral control. Further, we find that attitude toward the bike-sharing is positively affected by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the system. Beyond our expectation, subjective norm has no significant effect on the intention to use. Implications and directions for future research are also discussed.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the evolution of urban cycling in Montreal, Canada and its link to both built environment indicators and bicycle infrastructure accessibility. The effect of new cycling infrastructure on transport-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is then explored. More specifically, we aim at investigating how commuting cycling modal share has evolved across neighborhood built-environment typologies and over time in Montreal, Canada. For this purpose, automobile and bicycle trip information from origin\textendash destination surveys for the years 1998, 2003 and 2008 are used. Neighborhood typologies are generated from different built environment indicators (population and employment density, land use diversity, etc.). Furthermore, to represent the commuter mode choice (bicycle vs automobile), a standard binary logit and simultaneous equation modeling approach are adopted to represent the mode choice and the household location. Among other things, we observe an important increase in the likelihood to cycle across built environment types and over time in the study region. In particular, urban and urban-suburb neighborhoods have experienced an important growth over the 10 years, going from a modal split of 2.8\textendash 5.3\% and 1.4\textendash 3.0\%, respectively. After controlling for other factors, the model regression analysis also confirms the important increase across years as well as the significant differences of bicycle ridership across neighborhoods. A statistically significant association is also found between the index of bicycle infrastructure accessibility and bike mode choice \textendash{} an increase of 10\% in the accessibility index results in a 3.7\% increase in the ridership. Based on the estimated models and in combination with a GHG inventory at the trip level, the potential impact of planned cycling infrastructure is explored using a basic scenario. A reduction of close to 2\% in GHG emissions is observed for an increase of 7\% in the length of the bicycle network. Results show the important benefits of bicycle infrastructure to reduce commuting automobile usage and GHG emissions.},

  abstract = {Electronic market is a new economic space created by the development of the Internet and it has more than a billion of potential customers. In addition to all of the elements that define a classic market, e-market generates entirely new ways of doing business, such as the shared economy. Shared economy is a sustainable economic system built around the sharing of private assets. This rather new system mostly relies on information technology (P2P) to empower individuals and other profit and non-profit organizations with ways of sharing excess capacity in goods, knowledge and services. Considering the fact that reliance and safety are crucial factors when it comes to sharing private assets, the value of those assets is increased just by sharing information about them. Airbnb.com, as an outstanding example of the new e-business model, enables individuals to rent their unoccupied living space and other short-term accommodation to guests. Besides being a rental mediator, Airbnb is also a social network used by its users to exchange experiences and interests related to traveling. The research was conducted by an online survey that was posted on the Airbnb Facebook wall. The objective of this research is to determine the structure of Airbnb users and certain advantages and disadvantages of this type of ebusiness. The data acquired by this research was processed by the methods of descriptive statistics.},

However, this overwhelming toll has not been distributed equally, with geographic, race/ethnic, age, and socioeconomic disparities in exposure and mortality defining features of the US coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic.We used individual-level COVID-19 incidence and mortality data from the state of Michigan to estimate age-specific incidence and mortality rates by race/ethnic group. Data were analyzed using hierarchical Bayesian regression models, and model results were validated using posterior predictive checks.In crude and age-standardized analyses we found rates of incidence and mortality more than twice as high than for Whites for all groups except Native Americans. Blacks experienced the greatest burden of confirmed and probable COVID-19 (age-standardized incidence, 1626/100 000 population) and mortality (age-standardized mortality rate, 244/100 000). These rates reflect large disparities, as Blacks experienced age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 5.5 (95\% posterior credible interval [CrI], 5.4\textendash 5.6) and 6.7 (95\% CrI, 6.4\textendash 7.1) times higher than Whites, respectively. We found that the bulk of the disparity in mortality between Blacks and Whites is driven by dramatically higher rates of COVID-19 infection across all age groups, particularly among older adults, rather than age-specific variation in case-fatality rates.This work suggests that well-documented racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality in hard-hit settings, such as Michigan, are driven primarily by variation in household, community, and workplace exposure rather than case-fatality rates.},

In Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel revenue is in the 8\%\textendash 10\% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform, with lower-priced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business travelers being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily through less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers, not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the South by Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of peer-to-peer platforms\textemdash enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet demand.},

  abstract = {The existing research has largely focused on the impact of sharing economy on incumbent industries while ignoring the interactions among sharing economies. In this study, we examine how ride sharing services such as Uber and Lyft affect the demand for home sharing services such as Airbnb. Our identification strategy hinges on a natural experiment where Uber and Lyft exited Austin in May 2016 in response to the introduction of new regulations in Austin that targeted ride sharing services. Applying the Difference-in-Difference approach on a 9-month balanced longitudinal data spanning 7,300 Airbnb properties across 7 US cities, we find that the exit of Uber/Lyft led to a decrease of 9.6\% in the Airbnb property demand, which is equivalent to a decrease of \$6,482 in the annual revenue to the host of an average property. We further find that the exit of Uber/Lyft reduced the (geographic) demand dispersion of Airbnb. The demand became more concentrated in areas with access to better public transportation services. Moreover, the properties farther from downtown experienced greater decreases in their demand in the absence of Uber/Lyft. The results indicate that Uber and Lyft affect the demand for Airbnb properties primarily by reducing the transportation costs to and from Airbnb properties that otherwise have poor access to transportation services.},

  abstract = {Urban spatial structure in large cities is becoming ever more complex as populations grow in size, engage in more travel, and have increasing amounts of disposable income that enable them to live more diverse lifestyles. These trends have prominent and visible effects on urban activity, and cities are becoming more polycentric in their structure as new clusters and hotspots emerge and coalesce in a wider sea of urban development. Here, we apply recent methods in network science and their generalization to spatial analysis to identify the spatial structure of city hubs, centers, and borders, which are essential elements in understanding urban interactions. We use a `big' data set for Singapore from the automatic smart card fare collection system, which is available for sample periods in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to show how the changing roles and influences of local areas in the overall spatial structure of urban movement can be efficiently monitored from daily transportation.In essence, we first construct a weighted directed graph from these travel records. Each node in the graph denotes an urban area, edges denote the possibility of travel between any two areas, and the weight of edges denotes the volume of travel, which is the number of trips made. We then make use of (a) the graph properties to obtain an overall view of travel demand, (b) graph centralities for detecting urban centers and hubs, and (c) graph community structures for uncovering socioeconomic clusters defined as neighborhoods and their borders. Finally, results of this network analysis are projected back onto geographical space to reveal the spatial structure of urban movements. The revealed community structure shows a clear subdivision into different areas that separate the population's activity space into smaller neighborhoods. The generated borders are different from existing administrative ones. By comparing the results from 3 years of data, we find that Singapore, even from such a short time series, is developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form, where new subcenters and communities are emerging largely in line with the city's master plan.To summarize, our approach yields important insights into urban phenomena generated by human movements. It represents a quantitative approach to urban analysis, which explicitly identifies ongoing urban transformations.},

Most recent bike sharing systems produce time and location specific data, which enables the study of travel behavior and mobility of each individual. However, despite a rapid growth of interest, studies on massive bike sharing data and the underneath travel pattern are still limited. Few studies have explored and visualized spatiotemporal patterns of bike sharing behavior using flow clustering, nor examined the station functional profiles based on over-demand patterns. This study investigated the spatiotemporal biking pattern in Chicago by analyzing massive BSS data from July to December in 2013 and 2014. The BSS in Chicago gained more popularity. About 15.9\% more people subscribed to this service. Specifically, we constructed bike flow similarity graph and used fastgreedy algorithm to detect spatial communities of biking flows. By using the proposed methods, we discovered unique travel patterns on weekdays and weekends as well as different travel trends for customers and subscribers from the noisy massive amount data. In addition, we also examined the temporal demands for bikes and docks using hierarchical clustering method. Results demonstrated the modeled over-demand patterns in Chicago. This study contributes to offer better knowledge of biking flow patterns, which was difficult to obtain using traditional methods. Given the trend of increasing popularity of the BSS and data openness in different cities, methods used in this study can extend to examine the biking patterns and BSS functionality in different cities.},

  abstract = {As an important part of urban public transportation systems, the feeder bus fills a service gap left by rail transit, effectively extending the range of rail transit's service and solving the problem of short-distance travel and interchanges. By defining the potential demand of feeder bus services and considering its relationship with the traffic demands of corresponding staging areas, the distance between road and rail transit, and the repetition factor of road bus lines, this paper established a potential demand model of roads by opening feeder bus services and applying a logit model for passenger flow distribution. Based on a circular route model, a route starting and ending at urban rail transit stations was generated, and a genetic algorithm was then applied to solve it. The Wei-Fang community of Shanghai was selected as the test area. Per the model and algorithm, the feeder route length was conformed to a functional orientation of short-distance travel and the feeder service of a feeder bus; the route mostly covered where conventional bus lines were fewer, which is a finding that is in agreement with the actual situation; the feasibility of the model and algorithm was verified.},

  abstract = {Travel mode identification is one of the essential steps in travel information detection with Global Positioning System (GPS) survey data. This paper presents a Support Vector Classification (SVC) model for travel mode identification with GPS data. Genetic algorithm (GA) is employed for optimizing the parameters in the model. The travel modes of walking, bicycle, subway, bus, and car are recognized in this model. The results indicate that the developed model shows a high level of accuracy for mode identification. The estimation results also present GA's contribution to the optimization of the model. The findings can be used to identify travel mode based on GPS survey data, which will significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of travel survey and data processing. By providing crucial trip information, the results also contribute to the modeling and analyzing of travel behavior and are readily applicable to a wide range of transportation practices.},

  abstract = {In this paper the findings are presented of a multinational study involving 27 companies that have adopted a `Zero Accident Vision' (ZAV). ZAV is the ambition that all accidents are preventable, and this paper focuses on how companies implement ZAV through ZAV commitment, safety communication, safety culture and safety learning. Managers and workers took part in a survey (8,819 respondents), company interviews and national workshops in seven European countries. A common characteristic of all the companies was the high ZAV commitment of their managers and workers, which often were embedded in the companies' business strategies. It is very likely that this commitment is the main driver for long-term safety improvements. This research supports the importance of safety communication for ZAV implementation, especially of: specific ZAV or safety promotion programmes, constant and updated communication on functional tools, and effective supervisor communication. Successful communication must ensure `relevant' information to respective organisational levels (not a one-size fits-all strategy), and allow for `decentralised' initiatives. This research also highlights the importance of safety culture for ZAV implementation, with ZAV companies having high survey scores on management safety priority, safety empowerment and safety justice. The results also support the importance of safety learning (incidents and good-practice) for ZAV implementation. Additional success factors were top management support and an `open atmosphere', systematic communication and dialogue on incidents, and a focus on things that go right. We conclude that ZAV is the basis for inspiring and innovative approaches to improve safety, as an integrated part of doing business.},
