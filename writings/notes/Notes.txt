Question 25 on the ACS form, shown in Figure 8-4, was first added to the ACS in 2003 to collect more information on seasonal populations. It begins by asking whether any household member ìlive[s] or stay[s] at this address year roundî; follow-up questions are asked only if the answer is no (that is, everyone in the household is only a part-year resident at this location). The question may provide some insight on snowbird and sunbird residences, as well as other situations like groups of college students renting a house or apartment during the academic year. However, by its design, the question falls well short of being able to provide information on a fundamental underlying question: the extent to which individualsí ìcurrent residenceî coincides with their ìusual residence.î

The continuous data collection of the ACS necessitates changes in variable definitions, sample weighting, and sizes:
Å° Residency rules are different. The ACS defines a resident by a two-month rule. The census rule is "usual place of residence" or wherever a person spends most of the year. ACS data may include seasonal populations in addition to year-round residents.
